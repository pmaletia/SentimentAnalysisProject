1,"Having ordered clothing items from China before, I added an additional size to the recommendation but the item was made all wrong! The sleeves are way too short, and it does not fit as pictured. Instead of the front piece draping across the shoulder to the waist, it snaps only behind the neck and causing the sides to split right below my bust.

When I contacted the seller (ACEFAST INC), they refused to even acknowledge the fit issue and actively discouraged me from returning the item--even though they were completely at fault as they are propagating an incorrect representation of the fit. My recommendation is to steer clear of this piece--unless you want to modify it with buttons along the front--or buy from another seller. But please, to save yourself the money, do not buy from ACEFAST INC as a third party seller at all.","Not as Pictured, Seller Unhelpful"

1,"I recently started bee keeping and thought this would be a fun piece to wear to my class. I have to say I was surprised by the quality and needed to return it.  My teenage daughter makes jewelry and the chain, ""pearl"" and amber ""stone"" were of a lower quality than she would use in her creations. It is unclear to me the target market for this. The theme read adult to me and the quality read child. Sorry. I know someone made this and loves it. It just wasn't a good fit for me.

I do understand that product that are cotton tend to shirk but not as terrible as this shirt did. I contacted the seller to see if we could exchange or return

This is what they responded with
We are sorry to hear that. Unfortunately once you wash an item it voids any warranty or return policy. We have not had this issue with the items purchased and wonder if the washing instructions were not followed on the shirt. These shirts are made of cotton and should not be washed or dried with medium or high heat. The email you have provided has been removed by amazon. We apologize for any inconvenience.

We have a ton of harley shirts and this one is the only one that has EVER turned into a 5 year olds tshirt. Very upset giving Harley Davidson clothing is not cheap by any means. So please if your thinking of purchasing a tshirt from this company make sure you don't wash/dry it.

1,"The bear appliqu on the front of the jacket and the stuffed bear on the back were not sewn to the jacket, they were simply tacked to it in two spots. Also the appliqu on the front that says 'Pombear' in the photos is just a weird jumble of random letters (MNKWJP-B). The buttons and eyes on the stuffed bear on the back are hot glued on, with hot glue strings hanging everywhere. There were lots of hanging strings as well that were left uncut. The color I received was not the color I ordered (received orange but ordered green). The buttons on the front are cheap plastic and say 'fashion' on them. Weird. I also ordered a size 1-2T, and received a jacket that would easily fit a 5-6 yr old. Pretty much everything about this jacket has something wrong with it. It looks cute, but is very poorly constructed and won't fit on anyone's 1-2 yr old.",ALL wrong.

1,"The primary merino/lycra blend fabric that 80% of the shorts are made with is awesome.
The ventilation zone fabric being used across the lower lumbar is a failed disaster.
The weak ventilation fabric is developing expanded holes, runs and tears simply from the process of taking the shorts off and putting them on.
The simple stress of pulling them on is tearing the fabric.
These are 80% awesome and 20% flawed disaster.
The failure is vent fabric is obviously well on its way to prematurely ending the lifespan of these.
Another case of designers selling themselves on a gimmicky idea without keeping track of the basics like toughness and longevity.
Maybe try the ventilation fabric in the crotch.
Maybe just trash the ventilation fabric because it is weak and failure prone.

Do not buy.
Icebreaker will come to their senses eventually and begin making these without that failure ventilation piece in the lumbar.

The smell is COMPLETELY overpowering.  When I first pulled out the belt, I loved the style and was so excited, but the smell was very overwhelming.  I have tried everything to remove it.  I even had to remove the packaging it came in from my house immediately because even that was making the whole house smell (from inside the covered garbage can).  I did everything I could think of to remove the smell from this belt.  I even hand washed it and  hung it outside for two days of snow and wind.  It was all I could think of that I hadn't already tried.  My husband came home from a business trip and the first thing he asked me was, ""Do you smell something funny outside?""

""Suede leopard"" is some crazy printed fabric that doesn't remotely resemble suede, leather or anything else I've EVER seen and the ""calf hair heel"" is some kind of shiny furry synthetic thing! The whole boot is so synthetic that it would go up in flames on my feet if I ran in them to catch a taxi! However, to their credit, they DO fit perfectly and ARE comfortable...other than that..DON'T DO IT. Will keep because probably too expensive to ship back...",Jury Is Still Out...Until Now..

So i ordered a pair of these, which in hindsight i guess ordering shoes online was pretty stupid because you cant try them on/return them (wont be making that mistake ever again) and it was odd they seemed great at first but after 2-3 days of working 6+ hour shifts on my feet, it was pretty apparent something was wrong, i could see actual lines on my feet after work where the sole/side of the shoe was digging into the inside of both feet. Turns out they are actually too narrow, now im a size 13 and have pretty large/flatISH feet so i don't know if its a personal problem like i have wide feet or its a problem with the shoe sizing in the larger sizes but yeah for me these are pretty much unwearable and since it took 2 shifts to even notice they were too narrow, they cant be returned and im out 60$

While the bottoms have rubber grips, they don't have a solid bottom so any moisture at all is going to seep right through.

1,"Ok, so after reading the description and the reviews, I ordered several sizes up. I ordered an XL. I'm 5'8"" and about 145lbs. It fit in my hip/underwear area, but was much too big in the waist area for me which added quite a bit of lumps and bumps from excess fabric around the tummy area. I've got large hips/saddle bags, and a small waist, so if I went smaller, it would give me camel toe, but would fit around my waist. I have this dilemma with most garments that fit the lower half. Also because of my large saddlebags, the straps dug in and gave me a horrible bumpy silhouette. I was hoping the straps would help minimize my saddlebags and possibly lift some of that fat to even out my hip dips. I was looking for a product to give me more of an hourglass shape, but it made things worse. Also, after pulling the garment up, the fabric deformed a bit in the stomach area. It's got some rigidness to it and tugging on it to get it over my hips caused it to warp and not lay flat anymore.",Don't buy if you have saddlebags

The seller soon contacted me and requested measurements for bust, waist, hips, height, and length from hollow to floor; accurate measurements were immediately provided. We were so excited when the dress arrived much quicker than the expected arrival date.....until my daughter tried on the dress.

The straps of the dress were way too long and there were large gaps between the stitches from the sides of the bodice to the straps. I could literally insert 2-3 fingers between the stitches. The dress hanged away from her chest exposing the breasts.
The dress was not knee-length as stated in the description. It was several inches above the knee. And the color red was not the deep rich red shown in the picture. It was a much brighter shade of red.

1,"Shoes were very small. My daughter wears a size 7 1/2 in most other shoes. Size 8 1/2 on these shoes was still too small and she could barely fit her foot in it. We took her to a sporting goods store and they told us that Adidas does tend to run a little more narrow and small. They measured her feet and brought her another pair of Adidas soccer shoes in a size 8 and they fit perfect! These Adidas Performance Women's Ace 15.4 soccer shoes have great color combinations, but they are constructed with many flaws. Very flimsy material compared to the Adidas we purchased in the sporting goods store. The insole was hard,not supportive and it did not have the words ""Adidas women comfort"" on it like all other Adidas soccer shoes at the store did. The shoe laces are much thinner then a typical shoe lace found on athletic shoes. There were stains or scuffs on the black area of the shoes. A metallic maker was used to place a number 18 on the sole of the left shoe! They did not come in the normal black with white stripes Adidas shoe box. I was very disappointed with the quality of this shoe.",Sizing is incorrect. Quality is not as good as other Adidas soccer shoes.
1,"I've had these boots for less than 2 months, and the zipper on the back came apart. It can't be repaired becaue it is not actually a real zipper, and does not zip up and down. I asked the seller to refund my money because the boots are defective and cannot repair the zipper. The seller will not provide shipping costs and the item must be returned in box it came in, which I no longer have. The lack of customer support for a defective item is the reason not to buy these boots. I am not willing to put more money into these defective boots to get less money back by having to pay for shipping.

Update: I discovered the zipper would actually zip up and down, after pulling so hard, I was worried it would damage the boot even more. The zipper is not functional, isn't supposed to be used to put on boot, and now it's stuck and won't zip all the way back up. Bending down, the zipper keeps pulling apart when worn. Poor design and poor quality. So the zipper does go up and down, but still defective because the zipper isn't strong enough to hold while wearing and comes apart, and now won't go all the way back up. I could try some oil but not worth it. Waste of money.","Defective, poor customer service"

Example =  a 30 inch waist x 2.54 = 76.2 CM & this number is a higher number than any of the small thru x-large sizes listed which means all the jacket waist is less than 30 inches.  The M size waist on the chart  is 57.5 CM =  22.34 inches. Even the extra large is less and 30 inches.  How can I buy anything based on the distortion?

But the real reason for the poor review is the appalling customer service. Anyone can make a bad product or be the victim of a manufacturing flaw, but the test is in how you deal with it. Apparently UGG is a sexy marketing facade over poor manufacturing quality, false claims, and inability to back the products they make. My wife loved these slippers. When they fell apart after a few days of soft indoor living, I took them back to the San Francisco location where I bought them and he said ""it looks like wear and tear"" and refused to replace them. He said ""think of them like car tires."" If my car tires failed me in 30 days I'd expect a replacement.

I usually wear a medium and went with a large, it fit good other than the short arms. It's really to bad that the jacket is put together so poorly because the camo pattern is great. I took a gamble on this product with no reviews done on it when i ordered. I hope this review helps other wondering if this is a hidden china value on amazon, it is not.

1,"... Authentic Coach bags always have their silk dust cover. I have this bag, having bought it within a local branch of their stores, so I would definitely know with this particular one, at least. Authentic Coach bags also each have their own serial numbers, which can be found inside the bag, beneath their creed. You can find it on the largest pocket, it's the leather patch. Look your bag up on their website. You should also check to see if all of the hardware matches perfectly, all brass, with the large enough pieces saying Coach on them. Good luck!

1,"I bought it to match a nice dress I am wearing to a wedding over the New Year's weekend. I thought it would be more ""classy"", but the ""gems"" are plastic. I bought the necklace and matching bracelet.  It looks classy in the photos, but looks worse than cheap costume jewelry, in reality. The necklace came in a small ""zip-lock""-type, clear bag and was shipped in a huge (8 1/2""X 11""), brown, padded envelope (overkill, to the max) and poor presentation. The bracelet is tight fitting and fits extremely snug around the wrist. It's fairly heavy on the wrist and is the same as the necklace (gems are plastic, cheap looking and ""cheesy""). Definitely cheap quality and cheap looking. I would not buy again and would be ashamed to give it as a gift.  However, on a positive note...the bracelet came in a nice blue box that displays the piece nicely. Thumbs down and wouldn't recommend if you want to look ""classy"" at a formal event...cheap looking, chain is dull metal of some sort, cheaply made, gems are plastic.

1,"Purchased this Sailor Moon wig since it had overall decent reviews and was affordable. Buyers describe it as coming messy but able to be restyled, so I thought it wouldn't be terrible, and I was in a rush for Halloween. Huge mistake, immediately filed a return.

Wig arrived to me far messier than I was expecting. It wasn't just the buns - hair was coming out in multiple places, and the wig cap was exposed where the buns met the wig due to sloppy styling. While I may have been able to restyle the hair to make it work and manage with the tangles, nothing whatsoever could be done about the fact that the wig cap itself is practically child-sized. I have a pretty big head and thick hair that makes wearing most types of hats an issue, so I was a little worried that some reviewers said this wig was small/snug. This wig is well beyond that. I have dozens of wigs, from cheap eBay costume wigs (cheaper than this one) to specialty fashion wigs, and none of them have anywhere near as much of a problem fitting over my head like this one does. For all the breathable lace it is made of, this wig cap is extremely poorly constructed because it has absolutely zero stretch, which all wigs need to have in order to comfortably fit over anyone's head and hide sideburns and hair at the back of the neck. Since it has no stretch, I don't even understand the point of the elastic strip hooks, besides maybe making it tighter for children?

I understand that ""you get what you pay for"" is a reality, and I may be convinced to concede that this wig is cheap for the quality of the fibers and the styling factor. But I simply can't ignore how messy it is and, like I mentioned, I've purchased several wigs much cheaper than this one that all at least have elastic in the wig cap and fit nicely over my head. If you plan on dressing up as Sailor Moon, I urge you not to settle for this wig.","so I thought it wouldn't be terrible, and I was in a rush for Halloween"
1,Shoe started breaking down pretty seriously as other reviewers have discussed. Entire bottom shoe sole has fallen out! Still a super comfortable shoe when new.

1,"the finish of this item is top notch. the latch was a little on the feeble side but nothing to serious. that said, I have a beef with this bracelet and with the company that sells them. In the Specs it states the bracelet is 8 inches long. after getting my bracelet home and eager to try it on imagine my disappointment when i realize the item will not fit my wrist, at all. Im not talking about being able to close the clasp and wearing the bracelet tightly on my wrist as strange as that would look. nope the two ends didn't even meet. I don't have thick wrists and could be considered on the medium-small range, but a 7 inch bracelet (thats what it measured) would never fit me or 90-95% of all guys. selling a bracelet that says its 8 inches long but its actually only 7 inches long, is how can i say this, dishonest? I am not going to go though the hassle of a return only to be sent another way to short item. I just chalked it up to lesson learned and gave the bracelet to one of my slender lady friends, and it fit her but almost snug. so buyer beware if you are looking for a bracelet to wear or as a gift to a guy -  DO NOT BUY THIS ONE IT WON'T FIT.

1,"The style looks nice but that's about it. In the product video, the material appears sheer as the model moves around. It is not sheer or elegant. The dress feels like a $5 nylon dress from Forever 21. The upper stitching is loose and after 2 washes, I have had to go over the stitches 3 times already. The quality is a nightmare.

The dress is also longer than in images. I'm 5'6"" and I thought the dress would be mid-knee but it was knee-length. That makes the dress look way more conservative and baggy. I had to get it hemmed or I would have returned it. I'm a size 4 but size small is too big and floppy. I look 6-months pregnant from some angles.

DO NOT wash with colors other than red/pink. The red is strong and will come off. Thankfully, I had just done laundry and washed this in my sink. So much red dye came off that I was worried it would stain my porcelain sinks. The color of the dress is more of a dark red, not a bright red like in the images.",Cheaper than Forever 21

The material is nice and they felt incredible for the half a minute I got to wear them, but the rip was so bad that I couldn't even wear them around the house. This company doesn't even deserve one star. This company is a joke and should NOT be allowed to get away with selling faulty products that can't even be worn around the house, that's how bad the rip was. I really wanted to keep them and just see the hole, but they're not even worth it because I know they'd just rip again somewhere else.

1,"I had my eye on this watch around Christmas time of 2014 as I had received a number of Amazon gift cards. A few of the Negative reviews dissuaded me from buying however it remained on my wish list. Low and Behold last week I gave in an purchased a used watch from a wholesaler, for the great price of 19.99, thank God I did not spend a penny more.  The watch arrived promptly and with no delay and is packaged in a  comically large box which if it had not been bent would have looked handsome, all be it huge on my dresser. The watch itself needs a huge box because it is giant! the circumference is so large that it looks like a small wall clock on my wrist. This however is my own fault for not paying closer attention to the measurements. To the watch build itself:
1. The watch looks quality from afar, however is extremely cheep. It feels like it is made of plastic and the only actual metal on it is the backing.
2. The Crown and dials feel like they might fall off at any minute
3. The studs in the leather band are for looks only the band is actually glued and also feel like they might pop right off if I decide to give a random high five
4. The ""Genuine Leather Band"" is already flaking after one day of wear.
I could go on and on about how disappointed I am in this watch, however I will simply say, save your money and invest in real watch from an established brand you trust because this one feels like it came out of a gum ball machine.",for the great price of 19

A few days later there were two massive holes in the only back pocket, rendering that pocket completely useless. These pants are garbage.

I was so looking forward to this cardigan because I loved the coloring. When it arrived I was sooo disappointed. The sleeves are in NO WAY full length. I have long arms and I have gotten used to sleeves sitting just at my wrist bone. I've learned to deal with it. The sleeves of this cardigan end at my elbow. It is so incredibly awkward looking. It is not like the picture AT ALL. In the front, it is a good thing it is not supposed to close because there is no way that it would. It rests back on my hips because it can't even wrap around my body. I am 5""6 125lbs so I'm not very big and this cardigan is WAY too small for me. The material of this cardigan is also VERY stiff. If you are looking for something soft or even semi soft, keep looking this is definitely not it. I would not recommend this cardigan for anyone due to the absolutely awkward fit of this cardigan. Shipping also takes a very long time due to this item not being in the United States.

I received this product free of charge last week to review. I highly recommend this bag. Since it is summertime, i used this bag the whole week for my outings with my children, and will continue to do so. The deep, zip-close front compartment came in handy to store tissues, keys, wallet and phone, with room to spare for additional items.  We put water bottles in the 2 side mesh pockets. This bag held our lunches, snacks, drinks and small blanket for a picnic at the park.  It was easy to carry 10+ books that we checked out at our local library.  The padded straps are very comfortable on the shoulders. This backpack is very durable and of good quality. My only dislike is that it does not have a name tag. Specifically,  it does not have an outside clear slot on the back like some other backpacks do where you can write your child's name and any other information for school use.

1,"The most important thing to note about this dress is that it's made of very thick, very heavy satin that has absolutely no flexibility at all. It's almost more like upholstery fabric. The only way for a dress made from this fabric to look nice is if it's perfectly tailored, which mine sadly wasn't. Currently it's at an alteration shop getting fine tuned for my wedding by a very talented seamstress. We've had to have multiple refittings and her work is going to cost me $170.
Some of my issues with this dress:
I ordered a dress with a full back and it came with the draping still attached. I'm sure that part is my fault, but i have to include it in my review because i didn't want it and it looks ridiculous. With the fabric as thick and stiff as it is and with the full back it looked like a cape.
The shoulders were too long by about an inch.
 Whoever made this dress stretched the top portion near the collar along the bias as they were sewing, resulting in there being just TOO MUCH bulky fabric along the front and back collar line by about 2-3 inches. The thick bulky nature of the fabric means that that extra, stretched out bit matters a LOT because none of it was laying across my skin, just awkwardly bulging.
Inside of the dress the hems are a mess. Along the back collar there was one giant thick piece of bias tape going in one direction, then another going in the other direction and meeting in the middle to make a weird lump in the back.
The waistline is a mess. All of the pleats bulge out and none of them lay flat.

The good parts? The torso did fit my measurements, I like the length, and I like the appliques. I can already tell that this dress will be beautiful when i pick it up next week, but that's thanks to the seamstress, not the original makers. It is so disappointing to buy a custom tailored dress, then rush it to get fixed for almost 3x what it costed.",Buyer beware!

Here's the email I wrote to Adidas...I'll let you know if they're willing to resolve the situation at all:

Hi There. I'm an owner of one of your pairs of hiking shoes, Ax2 Beta Mid Hiking Boot, Black/Vista Grey/Power Red, size 11.5.  I own many pairs of Adidas, namely your Tour 360 & other model golf shoes, running shoes, etc... and have never had a problem with them whatsoever.  These particular hiking shoes though, are falling apart, where the sole is separating from the shoe itself, on the inner side, up near (but not quite at) the toe area.  It's a separation that's about 2"" wide and I can stick my finger in the hole and feel my foot.  The rest of the shoe is in 100% mint condition and I've never taken them hiking or in any type of rigorous situation. I paid $90 for these things and they've not lasted me 90 days.

Any thing you can do for me in this instance? These were obviously not constructed up to par with any of the previous Adidias footwear I've previously owned.",Absolute garbage..

I can barely get them zipped up without a sock.  There's no way I could ever wear my jeans tucked inside this
boot.  The flap on the top of the boot forever sticks out and looks ridiculous.  I suppose if someone was creative, they could attach some Velcro at the top of the boot to make the flap stay in place.  I realized when I purchased this boot because of the price, there may be problems with the fit.  There definitely was.  Whoever purchases this boot has to have a skinny, skinny ankle and leg or else they will be sending them back like me.  The style of the boot is really cool.  If it wasn't for the tight fit, I would have kept the boot.  They are really cute and no one would be able to tell they aren't real leather.  Just be sure to size up if you want to wear a sock with them for winter.  Even then, they run narrow.  I'd give this boot 5 stars for the syle and 1 star for the fit.",Very Tight Fit...But Cute Boot

1,"I recently bought a pair of these boots for my son for a November hunting trip in Idaho. The first day out after less than an hour his feet were cold. He was wearing a fairly heavy Merino wool sock. The temps were about 40 degrees and we were not in snow! He switched to his older less insulated boots and his feet were fine. I'd like to meet the Columbia employee who has worn these boots at -65! The temperature rating is total marketing hype! The boots look good and fit well, but are not warm. When you inspect the boots closely you see that the area where the rubber rand comes around is very thin. There is decent insulation in the tongue, but the toe and foot box area are very compressed. These boots might be fine for an urban user or for outdoor use during Sept. or early Oct in the mountain states, but your feet would freeze anytime after November if you spend any time outside. I am most upset with the false advertising for the temperature rating on these boots, it is so completely exaggerated! I would not recommend these boots to anyone who spends time outdoors during the winter, particularly for activities where you are not VERY active!",Do not measure up!
1,"I loved everything about these approach hikers--they are light, beautifully constructed, comfortable (go one half size up) and perfect for their intended. Unfortunately, they have a fatal flaw, namely the V-shaped plastic piece on the transition lace--the one that extends down to the wire with the two yellow attachments--broke after only about 40 miles of easy trail hiking:  pulled off the yellow attachments.  The free floating plastic piece then caused two bad falls by catching an eyelet on the adjacent boot.  Needless to say they went back (to REI actually).  Once Salewa fixes this problem, I likely will buy another pair they are that good...","Fabulous boot, fatal flaw..."

And hey  I GET that it was a long shot, as I'm 5'2"" and 110 pounds, but it's hard to receive clothes this comically ill-fitting without feeling like some sort of a freak. I get it, I never grew past the size of an 8th grader. Cool. Cool.
Besides the fit, there are just a lot of things about these pants that confuse me. They are not the brand marked online. The tag reads ""Annabelle 2XL."" Don't know who Annabelle is or what planet she grew up on, but somebody should let her know that these pants are not worth 30 Earth dollars. I'm also not sure why she thinks 2XL is one size fits all. Are you there, Annabelle? It's me, Emily  your pants made me very sad.
Somebody referred to this in the comments as heavy fabric? Description says cotton? It's 95 percent rayon 5 percent spandex, per the tag. Guys  GUYS  have I love my mind? Why is Annabelle punking me like this? SOS.
Attached for reference are pics me wearing the pants the only way they fit, which sorta just makes me into an unfortunate armless bat. Cheers to that. Maybe I'll turn them into a Halloween costume  ""sad black sack."" Probably just gonna return them, though.",I'm confused. Are these even the pants I ordered?

I ""was"" very excited to get the dress and immediately tried it on. I am a true size 10 and noticed it a little large. HOWEVER, as I was putting the dress away, while the paper detachable hanging dres tag says 10; the sewn in dress tag states ""Canada 10, US12"".

Overall, I am disappointed that I paid $60.00 MORE (!!!) for the color just to buy a dress that us too big. I don't have time to return and will deal with it. The style kinda hides it.

This time, I packed up my new shoes for a trip, specifically chosen for an outfit.  When I put them on, they were HUGE in the width and while I had no other choice but to tough-it-up, I had to wear them throughout the day.  When I arrived home, I took the shoes to my repair man.  He could only stuff them with heel pads.  This is simply NOT working.  Since I purchase all my shoes, etc. on my Amazon Prime and have worn these, is there any way to resolve this issue?  Can I return them, receive a credit and purchase another shoe?  I look forward to your response.  I LOVE Amazon Prime and tell everyone so that they might sign up!

I love these shades!!!
BUT, the little rubber nose cover comes off...BOTH last year and this years redesign.  This causes the hard underlying plastic to be very uncomfortable and even break the skin from rubbing.
Even if you don't lose the rubber piece...it will not stay back on once it's come off... so,  the glasses are worthless!
The frames/arms bend and break VERY easily at the attachment.  I've got another pair that fall off my face when i look down! There is no visible damage to the frame, but something happened and now, they just fall of... and of course, the nose piece fell off too.
Just wayyyy too expensive for the low quality frame!

I am not hard on sunglasses AT ALL!
My other shades are old school wire armed Carerras with the plastic body...a far more fragile design, that i wear i n the same situations and surroundings... driving, boating and beach.

These feel and look great...
But won't last long...2 pair per season ain't cheap...my Carerras last a year or more easy,  before i get a scratch that makes me buy another.

The second and very large problem is that the credit card slots in this thing are not only very narrow (which Im sure would stretch over time) but, after putting my two most important CCs in it are now EXTREMELY sticky with some sort of glue or adhesive, and these two CCs are more than likely both going to have to be replaced. I paid $160 to have CC slots that Im unable to use due to SEVERE stickiness, and my bag is the wrong color. I can deal with the color, I love the wallet/crossbody/wristlet however, since Im inconvenienced to the point of not being able to use the CC slots, if I keep this, I should not have to pay full price.

1,"This dress looks great out of the box. Fits very well. The issue is that the strips of floral fabric strips that make the dress so pretty and unique are not sewn in place. During the very first wearing, threads from the strips start to shift and pull out. Initially it gives a bit of a cool effect. But with the second, third, and fourth wearing I was pulling threads off of my pants and upholstery as they came out over the course of the day (worn only to work, average work day 8 hrs, nothing strenuous). By the end of the fifth wearing so many threads are either missing, or hanging half out of the fabric strip that the dress looks a MESS. I mean, A MESS. It is embarrassing. Even worse, near the hem of the dress whole 1/2-1 inch sections of strips have come out leaving what is essentially a large hole. I imagine it will shred apart soon as the stitch of the hem is now poorly supported. I don't know how many more wearings I am going to get out of this $160 dollar dress. It is so frizzy and messy looking that I can only wear it now with a coat over it (I wear a white coat to work). I can't wear it if I need to give a lecture or go to a meeting because the dress is no longer presentable and professional looking on its own. I wish I could get my money back for this dress.

1,"The shoes didn't fit even though I followed all the suggestions to ordered a size larger than what I usually wear.  They were way too big, and I probably should have ordered a size smaller than what I usually wear.  The seller ""agreed"" to ""let"" me return it but I had to pay the postage for it back to Japan....$45 the cheapest rate....PLUS pay a 20 to 50% ""restocking charge"" (they wouldn't tell me what exactly it would be until after I returned it).  Any refund I might get would definitely have been wiped out by the cost of return postage and the mystery ""restocking"" charge. I would suggest NOT ordering anything from this seller as the sizing is very unpredictable and the chances are good that you'd have to send it back and end up paying an outrageous price for the item.  I am giving the shoes to my local bike shop to give to someone who can use them and will pay a little more to find a local seller.",Be sure to read the VERY fine print.

Wow! I bought this costume last year and LOVED IT! Not only was it completely inappropriate and offensive -- it fit really well too! J/K. We want this costume taken down!
I thought wearing this costume would boil an entire culture down to a racist stereotype. And I was right: Turns out, I was representing the culture in a super inaccurate and unflattering way! We want this costume taken down!
The best news: I wore the costume on Halloween to be funny. Then the next day I took it off, and I was just me again. Isnt it awesome that I didn't have to deal with the racism or oppression some people actually experience on a daily basis? Best Halloween ever! LOL BUT SERIOUSLY: take the costume down.",wOW!!!!

I find that I have to put something else of similar size in the phone section when I'm using my phone in order to hold the shape of the clutch.  When my phone is in the clutch the closing snap comes open at the slightest movement.  This isn't an issue if it's in my purse but it is a concern when I'm using it as a purse.

It loses several hours in a 24-hour time period, not just minutes. You can't read the back to find out what battery you need to replace it. Mine might just be a fluke, but I wouldn't buy another one. I will have to take it apart to find out the battery number and try to replace it. It is listed as a ""non-ordinary"" battery in the product description. Not very hopeful. Too bad. I really liked it.

The mesh is just too soft to support the zipper so the zipper has a life of its own.

Yesterday, I noticed the tread was starting to peel away from the bottom of the shoe.  This could have been detrimental if I wore these on an expedition or mini multi-day trip.  The price of these shoes should dictate some level of performance, and the shoe should not be falling apart from casual use.  Maybe if they were worn daily all day but again, these were worn casually.  I'm very disappointed and somewhat skeptical to replace them with the same brand.

1,"The Earth Sisal sandals have been nothing short of a complete disappointment.  I've purchased and worn Earth sandals, heels and boots in the past, and this summer made a decision to replace a pair of worn out Birkenstock Gizeh sandals with the Earth Sisal.  I deeply regret that decision now.  They are nothing like the quality Earth shoes I've purchased previously in either styling, materials or comfort.

The footbed is very hard, and has little cushion to it.  The hard rubber sole is suprisingly inflexible.  The upper is very hard material and looks like what it is:  artificial.  I have had the sandals for several weeks now, and the material has no ability to ""break in"" and soften up.  I'm worried about potentially getting the foot bed wet because it looks like a cheaply painted piece of very thin vinyl glued and then stitched to the sole--I'm worried if these ever get wet, the top vinyl piece looks like it's waiting to come loose.

A word about the sizing:  I religiously wear 9.5 in Earth and have for years (for contrast, I also wear a 39 in Birkenstock, 41 in Dansko).  The placement of the thong piece when contrasted with the size of the sandal itself it off--in order to avoid my heels hanging off the back, is not right.  The soles of the sandals themselves are incredibly small, so there's no place for your foot to go at all if they are off a little bit.  It also means the arch support of the foot is off, compared to other Earth shoes, and is pretty uncomfortable.

This will be the last pair of Earth sandals I purchase--back to the Birkenstock Gizeh, which I can count on for reliability in terms of sizing, craftsmanship, and durability.","Don't Bother, Unusually Poor Quality Sandals"

The Good:
(The positive qualities of the item)
-Geoffrey Beene fitted shirts fit better than any other J.C. Penny quality dress shirt that I've tried. I wore similar shirts for a long time and decided to order more (unfortunately they don't sell them in stores anymore). Very slim fit, as I have wide shoulders and a narrow stomach, this contours very well.
-The color looked very nice, quite similar to what is shown on the product page, though I wish the black was darker.
-The material is thin but soft and breathable. Works very well with a suit jacket. May be a bit thin to wear by itself.

The Bad:
(The qualities that may be negatives or unexpected for some)
-Not really no-iron. You will need to iron this shirt after a bit of use, if you'd like to remain looking professional. However it is wrinkle resistant.

The Ugly:
(The downright negative qualities of the item, defects, areas needing improvement, etc.)
-My shirt came with a huge rip in the sleeve. I didn't open it for a couple months after I received it as it was packaged nicely and I didn't think anything would be wrong with it. By the time I noticed, I figured it was too late to do much about and was too busy with school to deal with the whole process of trying to send it back, etc. Ended up tossing the shirt out.

--

Final Recommendation: Consider
-Really like the Geoffrey Beene Fitted shirt, and it fits exceptionally well if you like a more modern/athletic cut. Just be wary, and be sure to look over the shirt immediately upon receiving it for defects or damage.

How I Rate:
- Five Stars - Accomplishes purpose for purchasing and greatly exceeds expectations.
- Four Stars - Accomplishes purpose for purchasing and meets all expectations; item is and works as described.
- Three Stars - Accomplishes purpose for purchasing but does not meet all expectations; misleading posting or small defects.
- Two Stars - Reasonably accomplishes purpose for purchasing but significantly deviates from expectations/has numerous flaws.
- One Star - Does not whatsoever accomplish purpose for purchasing. Entirely flawed, defective or deceitful.","Quality Assurance Problems, Consider With Care!"

After wearing once, I am noticing some pilling up and wearing on the fabric after an average days use. I don't expect them to hold up long, and at the price, you should be able to have that confidence. I have another pair that I order along with this one that has some screen-printing that is already starting to peel.

Update: These lasted maybe 3 months? Maybe 2.5 months? They have now completely worn out and have a hole in the toe. They are just not really very good quality.

They do have great traction, however the design does not encourage a natural stride and were forcing me to heel strike rather than land midfoot, causing pain in an ankle I've previously had surgery on. It may be that the pair I ordered is slightly too long even though I ordered a half size down from my usual running shoe size, but it seems like the issue is that the toebox is pretty large relative to the back of the shoe and the rubber end on the front tip is just too much bulk up front. I didn't really find the rubber chunk was beneficial, I'd rather the tops of the shoe get some mud/water on them than heel strike. I think I little elevation in the back of the shoe or longer rubber tracks in the back would help offset the front of the shoe.",Too much shoe in the wrong places

2,"I was super-excited to finally get  a pair of these!  I immediately added my own insoles, so I can't comment on the arch-fit.  Given my experience, I'm not sure I would purchase from hot chocolate again.

I have two negative observations:

1)The hot pink sole edge is peeling - there appears to be an overlay coat (of vinyl/rubber/latex?).  The under-color is a hotter pink, which is nice, so once the peeling is completed, I don't think I'll mind the color if it stays.  The secondary problem is that they pick up dusty footpath dirt easily; these shoes will have to have higher maintenance than one might expect from their flat-soled utilitarian look.

2)  The left sole is peeling away from the shoe in the toe area, which is pretty bad considering these shoes have only been in use for three weeks.  A bit of shoe goo should solve the problem, so I expect that the underlying materials will give me at least 6 month of wear.","Nice materials, poor construction."

I ordered this shirt in a large because my husband is a small or medium depending on what type of shirt.... All you have to do is pay attention to the size chart given on here. This shirt is low balled with bad ratings for the sizing rather than its quality which brings me to my next point.
The style on this shirt is really nice, very fashionable and grabs attention.. I like that aspect of this shirt, however this shirt's downfall is in its quality... The fabric used to make this shirt is rather flimsy/thin and just cheap... I washed this shirt after my husband used it for the first time last week during a local soccer game and it's already looking rather fuzzy.

I have bought other shirts from jeansian before... This is by far the worst one I've recieved, the others are by far better quality.",I'd like to point out a thing or two about these ...
2,"UPDATE: I LOVE these sandals and have worn them almost everyday since I got them. However, eventually the top layer of leather separated from the cloth that's glued underneath in the side strips so it looks ragged. I glued them back together again, which is a bit difficult to do, but they separated again a month after I did that. I wish all of the leather and cloth were sewn together, rather than some of them being glued together.  I'd pay more for that because it would extend the wear of these sandals by years,

I usually wear a size 6 and have a slightly wide forefoot. These sandals were extremely comfortable right out of the box. Since my foot is a bit wider than the standard B width, the straps held my toes together a bit snugly at first but not to the extent that it was painful. Eventually with enough wears, the straps did loosen up and my toes have all the wiggle room they need. I'm sure that if you have a standard width foot, the straps would probably loosen a bit just from side to side movements as you walk, but they wouldn't loosen as much as they did for me due to my wide feet.",Cute & comfy but they took shortcuts on workmanship

In my opinion, the actual size range is 6 - 8, maybe 6 - 8.5. I'm going to give these to my mother. I'm sure they will fit her just fine. I just wish I hadn't bought two packages of them and unpackaged them both before being sure they fit.",These are WAY TOO SMALL for the stated size range!!!

2,"Compared to other Curvy Fit trousers from Rafaella, these pants tend to run smaller than others. Regardless, Rafaella is generously sized. I do like these over the other bootcut ones, largely because there is a smaller tab & no buttons at the fastening ... which means less extra fabric & buttons right on the belly. I also like no belt loops, so that these pants have a more professional look.

However, certainly watch the items that you receive from Amazon. I received 2 pairs, and both clearly were returned purchases and were excessively wrinkled. One pair did not even have tags, was pilled, and worn at the ends. Looked like something from a garage sale. Not certain where this supply of Rafaella has come from but it can't be trusted. Thankful for easy returns though.","Like the pants, smaller than others from Rafaella, but inspect your items carefully"
2,"Beautiful color!  Perfect size.  Nice bling accents.  Very poor zipper design overrides all the positives.  If you use the zipper closure, you must totally unzip it, meaning the zipper is separated on both ends, like on a jacket.  Very awkward, difficult to line up the separated zipper to reclose it.  If you don't zip it, problem is eliminated.  Was also disappointed in how this item was packed - or should I say, not packed - for shipping. It was wrapped in a plastic mailing bag, not a box.  Because this is not a soft-leather bag, it is amazing that it wasn't crushed during shipment",To Zip or Not...

The stinkyness that others have commented on seemed to be mostly from the mailing package.  Once the shirts were removed from the bag and had sat out awaiting gift wrapping, the odor disappeared.  My big complaint was that once the shirt was washed (according to the washing instructions), one of the shirts faded to almost nothing.  The design was very faint.  Multiple shirts, washed at the same time, by the same person, in the same manner, and just the one fades. Glad I got multiples :(  The person whom the gift was for, was very disappointed.

2,"This is another very cheaply made-in-China product, imported from Canada. First, the lid isn't connected to the base with a hinge, but with a singular strip of material that simply goes from the base to the lid.  It appears that if you were to open and close this case a few hundred times, the felt-covered cardboard would just tear in half, same as any thin material would do when folded back and forth many times. This type of hinge causes the lid and base, when closed, to be movable.  In other words, when the box is closed (but not latched), the base and lid don't even line-up and can move around since the only connection between the two halves, is a sheet of felt covered cardboard extending from the base to the lid. Next, since the lid and base wobble, the latch can be difficult to open. And finally, the rows where you store your jewelry are not adequately plush enough to actually hold typically thin-stemmed cufflinks so they are very loose and will easily fall out of place with minor box movement.  The width of a ring is greater than the width of a cufflink so this box is better used to hold rings - it's useless for cufflinks.",Not good for cufflinks - okay for rings...

2,"I hate writing bad reviews but given the cost of this jacket and bibs, I find it imperative i give my honest stance.

I had been waiting for this bib jacket set to be released and was super excited to get them. Now, I fish on saltwater in New England, a lot. I had high hopes and was honestly very happy with the set, that is until it rained. For warmth, comfort being livht weight, this set had not failed, and keeps you warm in early spring and fall fishing. HOWEVER, if it rains more than misty fog, you may as well be wearing nothing. The set held its water repellancy for maybe 2 trips, then it became a sponge and the water proofing conpletely failed. Not only was the jacket saturated, water was literaly dripping down my back on the inside, with the hood on. The chest pockets had about a tablespoon of water in them, and the sleeves of the shirt i was wearing were soaked. The only somewhat dry part of my shirt underneath was probably a 8-10 circle on my stomach area.

I'm really aggrevated about the whole situation... and 500+ dollars later, here I am back to square one. These people at Stormr need to do a lot more R&D with actual heavy fishermen, instead of there typical tactics of allowing basically anyone being part of ""team Stormr"".

In conclusion, if you want an expensive combo to keep you warm and protected from wave spray, this is the set for you. If by chance mother nature decides to rain while on water, bring an umbrella because thats the only protection you'll get.","After 12 dry trips, the first raining trip...."

I first went to the pool, and every time I tried to jump up orswim around the top of the swimsuit would start to fall down, to the point where I had to constantry lift it up to ensure that my tits* weren't falling out. I thought that it had something to do with the cups in the bra pushing my girls up so I removed them and wore this bikini again to the beach.

I am a size 12 generally, and choose large tops most of the time.  I grabbed this in an XL to be on the safe side, imagining I would wear it under a cardigan or over a swimsuit top anyway.

In my opinion it fits like plus size 2X or so...when it arrived via mail, I realized how large it was and laughingly put it on over what I was already wearing - a dress, jean vest, and leather jacket - and it easily fit!?!

More importantly though, it is very see-through, and the colors are very different than they appear on my screen.  Fluorescent/neon orange and beige.  It would be the hot trend item for 2012-2013 in my opinion.  I sent it straight back.

The vamp strap fit well across my toe area, but the sole seemed average, not wide. There was definitely some hobbit-foot overhang action on the sole. (Side-note: I lovingly call my feet hobbit-feet because they are so wide. I don't mean any offense to any wide-footed lovelies out there. I do, however, feel that we sometimes get robbed of wearing cute shoes because designers don't seem to understand wide feet...) There was a really hard plastic bobble around the between-the-toe strap, and it actually made them uncomfortable to walk in for too long. These are basically flip-flops, and I just don't have time for uncomfortable flip-flops. I don't think the bobble was supposed to come off (it seemed like a design feature), but I could be wrong. I'm giving a two star rating for the non-wide fit and the uncomfortable bobble, but if the bobble is removable and you don't have wide feet, these are actually pretty cute shoes.","Wide fit not really wide, weird plastic bobble between toes"

Additionally, I ended up having to take it for alterations, because it was significantly smaller than the measurements listed, and the seamstress told me that it appeared that it had already had alterations done on it.

first off great concept -finally someone thought of this. it works great and does what it says.  buuuut and huge but, they barely filled it with anything! I live in New Hampshire and it's not even warm enough for spring weather right now. I expected it to have a fill similar to the Patagonia down sweater. especially for the price!!!! so that is why I only gave it 2 stars. that was a big let down. on another note, not sure it's the company's fault or just the Amazon warehouse but it came with a funky smell.

However, during a two mile walk to and from class, I was barely able to limp home. The back of the heel rubbed a hole in my left foot and irritated the other one. The second toes of both feet have a painful red injury where the seam that goes down top rubbed against. This is even though the inside of the shoe at that point is smooth. What is more, the velcro on the top of the strap rubs into the top of the foot, and the bottom part of the strap rubs into the side of the foot.

2,"I travel a lot for business... When my cheap Dell backpack that I received with a new laptop finally died after almost 5 years (laptop died well before) of hard use, I took the task of finding its replacement very seriously.  I evaluated all the big names and no-names in my efforts before settling on the Travelpro.  Of all the negative comments the most common and consistent one was the lack of padding in the shoulder straps. I have never found a business travel backpack with enough padding, so I took that as given and figured it will not get any better than that.

It will be a year this April since I received the backpack and have put it through its paces. It has a pretty good amount space, and the pockets are ample in size and laid out pretty well.  There are some obvious missed opportunities to make it better, but I prefer a few large pockets to many smaller ones. This has a few large pockets. I was relatively happy with the product... maybe 3.5 stars.  However, in the last couple of months the seam where the top of the right shoulder strap meets the backpack has begun to tear. See attached picture.  I should probably give it a one star, but I like it otherwise. Plus, I have not given Travelpro a chance to remedy. I will reach out to them now and see what they have to say.  If my rating changes from a 2 star to 1 star rating you will know why.",Shoddy Construction...

update May, 2017: stopped wearing this about a year ago because my neck was starting to show some kind of rash. I've never had a skin allergy to my knowledge, and I don't know if it was the pewter or the plating. either way, had to take it off and hang it up.

update December, 2017: tried again on the off-chance it was a random thing, and it still caused a skin rash.

2,"These shoes are cute, that part isn't a problem.  They seem to run narrow--not a big deal with sandals, in my opinion.  However, they are uncomfortable!  I got them for a deal, so they really aren't worth returning, but it's really disappointing considering the brand.  The T part of the strap (that goes across the foot) is leather wrapped with gold beading.  It makes for a nice look, but the beading digs into the top of your foot as you wear them.  Worse than that though is the heel strap.  It doesn't matter what hole I adjust the buckle to, this strap does NOT stay up.  It seems like the angle of the strap was poorly designed, or at very least it should have been attached to the T-strap across the foot.  As it is right now, the heel strap will stay in place for maybe a dozen steps, then it falls down and since these are not like regular flip flops with the straps spread across the base of the toes to keep it in place, the sandal is very difficult to keep on your foot--you can't successfully where it as a slide sandal, so you're left walking while trying to keep your foot in the darn sandal the whole time.  Super disappointing.  I would give one star, except that they are very well made in terms of material and initial style, so I give it 2 stars.",Just pass on this shoe.

2,"I bought two pair of these a year ago ... one brown, the other black.  The two pair were visually different and the soles were nothing alike.  I have worn them to work every day, rotating brown and black on a daily basis.  (Yes, I know!) Over the course of the year, the black pair has been replaced twice.  The sole comes loose after a few months.  I tossed the last ones in the garbage last week.  The entire heel covering had come loose and it sounded like I was wearing flip-flops!  The entire sole is covered with a thin layer of rubber, that's what comes loose.
The brown pair?  The are still doing fine.  The sole is not loose anywhere.
All I could say is, if you're looking at these in black, go look at something else.  The black ones are just not up to the Dr.'s quality standards.","Definitely NOT up to ""the Dr.'s"" quality standards."
2,"The jacket was too small. we ordered by the size chart for a chest of 31"" but the size chart was wrong said for a 41"" chest. The jacket fit with no room for any growth. Very disappointed in the sizing and the delivery. I had to pick up the package at the Fed Ex hub because the instructions
were to deliver before 10:30 am and FedEx would not budge on that time even tho I ask for 5pm delivery. So I had to pick up jacket and then spend more money to ship it back which was another trip to post office. Not a satisfactory purchase at this point. If the small fits and is shipped to my door, I will not purchase any other clothing.

2,"My husband loved the design of this ring when he saw it and I was so excited to get it for him because this is his first Father's Day after trying and struggling to have a baby for 10 years. I wanted to love this ring and be proud to give it to him, but I am now so disappointed I want to cry!

First off, one of the only positive things I have to say, the ring did arrive two days ahead of the estimated delivery, and that is the ONLY THING keeping this from being given a one star review.
When I opened the box I was impressed that it did look nice and matched the picture, however all around the stone the ring is completely scratched up and just looks bad. I just thought, ""Well, can't return it now. It's the day before Father's Day."" And I knew my husband would look past this flaw because he'd say, ""I'll just end up scratching it anyway.""
The nail in the coffin though, is that I ordered a size 10 and the ring I received is definitely NOT a size 10. It didn't fit my husband's middle finger at all (which he said is a size 10). So I tried it on my middle finger which I KNOW is a size 10. It did not fit there either, but it fit my ring ringer perfectly. My ring finger is a size 9. Always has been without fail. This ring is a size 9.
For $39 plus shipping I expect the ring to at least be the correct size that was ordered.
The scratches we could live with, but there is absolutely nothing useful about a ring thst eon't fit. I will be contacting the seller directly about all these concerns, and requesting a refund or exchange.",So disappointed when i was so excited!

Vastly overpriced considering the quality of the product you're getting.","Prongs break easy, sub-par leather.  Very overpriced."
2,"I ordered a 5t but sent a 3t. The tag said 5t but the item was clearly much smaller, and the inside tag said 3t.

I will edit my review after I receive the other one if it is rectified.",Mislabeled so size incorrect.

2,"I agree w/ the other 2-star reviewer, my shoes arrived and I swear one of them was pre-worn. It was so much looser than its counterpart- like the strap had been stretched out. Very disappointing. Otherwise cute in appearance. Colors are true to picture.",Preworn?
2,"Not a comfortable shoe. Runs smaller than I expected. I wanted to return, but lost track of time and now I can't. Nuts.",The picture of the shoe is far more appealing than the shoe itself.
2,"The material is made from like a fitted sheet, although put together well. It is super long and hard to walk in because the opening at the bottom is so small. Very uncomfortable to try and sleep in because there is no stretch room at all, I ordered 2 sizes up. Everything dusty or hair sticks to this easy.","Weired material, had to knot the bottom to walk"

2,"The design of the dress is pretty but that's about it.  I made the mistake of relying on other reviews to order a size L for myself (160 lbs).  Unfortunately when I received the dress I opened it, took a quick glance and put it away.  I finally took it out yesterday more than a month after I ordered it to put it on for a party.  I was pretty bummed when I realized the dress was probably 2-3 sizes too small and wouldn't go past my breasts.  The L is more like a size 6.  To make matters worse, I quickly went online to request a return label and my order said that the return window had expired on July 7.  Double whammy.  I tried selling it to a cousin of mine who is smaller. She was about to say yes when she realized the stitching on the skirt part had already come undone from her just trying it on for 5 minutes.  Triple whammy.  She commented that this is why this dress is only $16.  The stitching is horrible and someone mentioned that the dress looks like it was made in someone's craft shop and they are correct.  It looks like it was made by a novice dressmaker.  The dress is slightly see-through as well.  I eventually just let my cousin keep the dress at no cost as I didn't want to hassle with trying to return the dress.  If you want a  dress to go to a wedding, graduation party, garden party or any day event,  this is NOT the dress for you.  If you are a college student on a budget and are looking for a fun, eye-catching dress you can wear to a night party or to a club, get it because $16 for a party dress to wear once or twice is worth it.  I would not have minded this dress in my college days.  But it's not a dress you want to wear in the daytime due to the quality of the material, the poor stitching and see-throughness for lack of a better word.  For this I would give it 2.5 stars if I could. But not 3. Or 4 and for sure not 5 stars.  The one last thing that I did not like is that it does not come with any tags; I had to have my cousin smell the dress to believe me that it was not a used.",The design of the dress is pretty but that's about it

2,"Don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this bag. Wanted a mid sized bag to commute with, but the size of this thing is comical! They say it's a good sightseeing bag, but other than a camera and a few small items this bag to me seems useless.  You sure won't be able to put any souvenirs you find while sightseeing into this bag. The quality of bag seems fine, though the strap is not long enough and is made of some kind of vinyl. Also the ""handle "" on top of bag seems like an afterthought and you can only slip three fingers into it.. They say they use special materials that preserve battery life of electronic devices you put in there.

2,"My wife got this to hold her Galaxy S5 (with otterbox). The phone fits nicely in there, and has enough room for her small wallet if needed.

The reason why I'm rating this 2 stars though, is that the plastic clip came warped, and the center ""track"" on the female end broke off, so it doesn't close properly. If you aren't careful when clicking it shut, the center piece of the male end skews to the side, making it near impossible to re-open. It's a good thing it's elastic, so my wife just slips it down past her feet. But for a well known brand such as this, I would expect the clip to work better.

I usually have more than ten bills of money, and it will not fit in the billfold....  the wallet can't fold and close at that point.

It was also too short (for anyone over 35).  I was hoping to wear it to a spring wedding but it didn't work. It maybe ok for a Jr./teen-ager.

That being said..at least advertise how small it is. HUGE WRISTLET TINY INSIDE.

2,"The bag arrived on time and was generally what I expected. The two stars is because the listing identified the bag as having a MSRP of over $300. I realize that different vendors price items differently, but when the bag arrived, it had an original tag still on it clearly stating $108. It doesn't change the item, I realize, but blatant misstatements leave a bad taste in my mouth.",False price advertising
2,"I bought a similar outfit from another seller with longer legs. I wanted something more summer appropriate and that's why I bought this.  It's really comfortable but there are a few downsides. It's almost see through so if you order this to fit you might want to wear something underneath it. And the straps are rather flimsy. This is a lot of material being held up by some rather small straps. This is my second time wearing this and I'm waiting on it to break.

Update: I've washed this twice and I'm ready to show the world my ass quite literally. I would have like to get the ""soft and flowy"" one from everyone elses pictures. I got a cheesy one",Almost but not there..........

2,"I want to love this as much as another of this brand.  The only problem is that the red jacket is paper thin.  You can see the stripes through it.  It is a good fit though and quite comfortable.

Update:  Originally I gave this 4 stars.  After wearing a few times, I must update and downgrade it to two stars.  The picture shows the stripes to run evenly. On my dress, the stripe goes up and down and is caught in a few places. The thin (think cheap) fabric and poor workmanship make this not worth the money any longer.  It looks like a cheap knockoff dress.

A positive is that it washes up beautifully and looks just as good coming out of the washer as it did going in. Also, it does not wrinkle during the day.  If you happen to get one that is well crafted, it will be worth 3 or 4 stars in my opinion.  Finally, the fit of the dress is magnificent.  It covers my bumps and dimples and swings nicely to a bit below the knees. It can wear all day and look just as good in the evening as it did when first put on.

I wish the company would address construction and fabric issues because the pattern of the dress is wonderful.  If they would fix these few things, they would have a five star product.","Great pattern, poor execution"

2,"I am writing this review right now from Paris. I wanted a somewhat stylish pair of waterproof boots that would also be comfortable for all day walking. I got somewhat stylish, I got waterproof, but these are NOT comfortable. Its a shame because I really love Ecco brand. My Soft 7 sneakers are amazing. They got me through a summer trip in Paris with copious amounts of walking and didn't even need breaking in. I was hoping it would be the same for these boots, but no. They are deceptively comfortable at first, but it doesnt last. They are a bit too small in the toe box, but if I sized up, theyd be too large in the heel. Overall, quite painful for the balls of my feet, and I cannot recommend this particular style of Ecco. But I can recommend the Soft 7 during dry weather.",Not right.
2,"Its OK, not great. couple 'issues' I don't like. 1) the damn hood is gigantic and weighs a ton...so heavy it pulls the front up onto the front of my neck and leaves a big uncovered area at the top of the back of my neck...half my shoulders are exposed. 2) when you sit down... it pulls up to the front of your neck ... very uncomfortable. Of course both of these can be remedied. for #1 I pull the hood up to the back of my neck and zip up higher ... but then I get hot and feel like I have a parka on...for #2 I have to pull the hood and back of this thing up while I sit...neither are monumental... but I think the hood should be removable...zip off and just have a collar... that'd be nice.
Other than these things....very nice quality, very nicely made, very soft and warm.
OK..updating the review. Decided to return it...just wasn't comfortable enough for $100. Ended up having to pay $19.00 to return it, plus cost of a box...- $4.00. $23.00 to return is ridiculous. I lost $23.00 for no reason, no fault of mine. I'd never order this online...if you have to have one, find a store and go try it on before you buy it....or be prepared to loose out on $23.00 if you need to return it.","It's OK, but could use some modifications, and they should be picking up returns...They charge you $23.00 to return it..."

Sleek, pleasingly aesthetic styling (note to self: never purchase an item on styling alone).

The 3-sided clasp closures are a PAIN to operate. Not once have I been able to engage all three clasps on the first try (it has taken 20+ attempts on a few occasions). No, the luggage was not overstuffed.

Scratches and scuffs easily. You'll want a cover for this piece.

Still cant figure out how to undo the interior lining tabs. The lining is 'removable' but good luck figuring out how to remove it.

The jeans make my butt look saggy, and I definitely need to wear a belt otherwise I'm constantly pulling up the pants. The calf area is still tight. The dark wash still has a smell to it months later, after multiple washes. I don't recommend this pair of pant.
-----------
This is my first pair of Vigoss jeans, and they are OK. The waist is a tad small, but I'm sure it'll loosen up a little after some wear. I recommend purchasing a pair in your typical size, or a size up if you're in between sizes. For Seven for All Mankind, I wear a 28, so I ordered this in a 28 and the waist fits fine. I could potentially purchase this pair in a size up in terms of calf area and leg opening.

Pros:
The pants are not too stretchy or jegging-like.
The wash is nice (I could personally do away with the whiskering, but it will do).

Cons:
Fabric is a little rough, even after washing; the jeans will require some 'breaking in.'
The calf area is tight; the largest part of my calf is 14"" in diameter. The pants don't cut off circulation, but since there isn't a lot of stretch to the jeans, it may be uncomfortable to some. However, this will allow for easy tucking into boots.
The length is 30"", so I'll need to hem the pair up a little.",I recommend purchasing a pair in your typical size or size down

2,"Good design in terms of platform to heel height, shaft height, and the stretch fabric back made calves sleek. But bad construction and awful materials ruin this boot. Plus it runs so small my big tow was banging up against the top while still on my bedroom carpet. Doubt I could wear them for an hour. Cheap looking buckle as well. I knew these couldn't be too well made for the price, but I was seduced by the design. Sadly, they are going back.","Good idea, sad execution. And Way too small!"

2,"I usually wear mostly 9. This shoe goes to small size. Make sure you go one half up. Be aware that the tighter the shoes you get more crease on upper leather will occur. Leather is soft and nice.

Update: The shoe I received found the left shoes is very tighter than the right one. I walked with them for about half an hour , Unfortunately this is what happened to my back of the left foot heel. (friction blister)

However, the pockets on the front aren't actually pockets at all. (!!?!!)They are sewn completely shut, and are just for looks I guess?. Whaaa?? However the pockets on the back are open and functional. So what's the point of sewn closed fake front pockets then? Again, the back pockets are open though. Very odd.
I think that's a little bit of deceptive advertising. They should be clear about this in the item description.",Front pockets are sewn shut!!??

2,"An update - Unfortunately, they did not last.  I've barely worn them, and as of today, they're at the shoe repair place being fixed.  The plastic ""cork"" has come apart from the sole.  Drag.  It's going to cost me almost as much to have them repaired as it would be to buy new ones.

I love these shoes!  I have plantar fasciitis, so finding a good shoe is always a challenge.  Especially with sandals.  I obviously can't wear my shoe inserts, so these shoes make me very happy!  They look cool, and seem to be made well.  I will have to add another hole to the top buckle however, but that's easy enough.  Might have to get them in both pink and white as well!","Falling apart, but I love them!"

2,"Looks great, but a little too small.  I also did not find it very warm.  I live around boston and hate the cold.  Reviews said very warm, but this feels like a fall jacket at best.  Not much better than a heavy fleece.  Maybe for just getting in a car and driving to work, but if you will be outside much, I did not find it acceptable.  For the price and the way it was advertised, I was expecting MUCH better warmth.  It is light and very compressible, if that is important to you...","Advertised as a winter jacket, but not even close."
2,"I give it two stars because it was very cute, however, on that note it was described as fitting larger chested women.  However this is not the case!  If it had a FULL built in bra it might have worked, but it was lacking a band around the bottom of the ""bra"" area which did not hold me in.  I read a review of a larger woman (42F) loving it and though it should work.  I wear a 38DDD and there was no way I could swim much less spend the day enjoying the water without holding me in.  I was fully disappointed.  I was even more so when going directly to the site which claims to have suits to fit all sizes, their inventory is lacking and they do not support larger breasted women.",Not for those of us with boobs

2,"The product looks nice and I was looking forward to using it. I looked at the manual because I couldn't see how to program anything, like correct date/time, and of course the other features. The booklet/manual explains that to use this product and program/adjust features, you need to download the app. So basically if you have a cell phone that is a year or so old, it's likely that your cell will say the phone ""isn't compatible"" with the app and will not allow you to download. I realize that this was probably explained in the description of the watch, or maybe that detail should be obvious or common knowledge (the need for newer cell/android/apple device), and I'm just too ""un-tech-savvy""....but it is still a disappointment. Does everyone buy new devices so you can have new/utd OS, because I sure don't and I'd imagine I'm not the only one. So my main disappointment is 1) must have latest apple/android devices that will allow this app to be downloaded, or is ""compatible"" for use of the app.  2) I would be stoked about the product if they could only allow you to make adjustments, update details/progress/logging of results.....on other devices or systems that aren't brand new or have latest OS s on them....., like your desktop or directly through their website?? It just disappoints because it keeps the folks who don't have the latest devices (cells/tablets and kindles) from being able to use or manage this device in any way. I'm going to need to return it and look into other watches/trackers that allow users who have cell phones/tablets bought a year or so ago...or those folks who might only have a PC (seniors perhaps?) to use the watch, even if you aren't able to sync your figures/results, or store longer than a few days....yet have the ability to use the device and program the needed info onto it...like date/time and the person's details/goals etc would be....without having to additionally own the latest devices or access to the app. :(  :(",Disappointed.

2,"I purchased these boots for $41.00 in April 2015.  They were one of four pairs of motorcycle boots that I own.

The shifter would have destroyed them in no time.  But, like I said, they were comfortable and they look good.  After less than two years of very light wear, the heel has separated from the boot.  Although disappointed, my thought was that for $41 I would try another pair.

I came back to Amazon hoping that on this purchase I would get more than two years of extremely light wear out of them.  However, they are now $81.  The price has doubled in less than two years.

2,"There are several issues to this watch, the main being the lacking customer support for warranty issues. The battery died after 6 months. There were no Lumiox dealers in the city, so I decided to use the official Rolex shop. After changing the battery I was informed that the watch needed a new watertight seal. This could only be done by Luminox. After much delay, Luminox management in Europe finally sent me the shipping address. After 8 months it was returned and now the digital clock does not match the analog hands, no matter how I try to adjust it. Having worn it for some time, the sapphire glass does not scratch. However, the bezel scratches easy, since it is titanium. The fluorescent tip above the number 12 has also worn away. I do not recommend wearing this watch while working with your hands.

As a founding member and space ticket holder at XCOR Aerospace I decided to purchase this watch directly from Luminox management at an XCOR event. The irony is the contrast between the Luminox lack of service and the passionate attentions XCOR Aerospace performs. As a part of the Founding 100, I was awarded a discount on the watch.

2,"This has weird cloth, not really regular tank top material.  When it says knit, it means knit, like a sweater.  The material is like the mexican baja hoodie material, but just thin.

2,"These are reaaaaallly cheap. Like worse than old costume jewelry you'd find at a yard sale.

2,"I got about three good uses out of this necklace and now the gold color is almost completely faded. Every time I would wear it I would constantly have to be untangling it. I guess that's why it's so inexpensive and even on sale on top of the already low price. Please also note I received this item on July 31 and today is August 8. All in all I got about 5-6 good days out of this necklace. I'm attaching a photo of the necklace with a good quality ""gold tone"" necklace I've owned for months lain over it to compare the change in color.","Fades fast, tangles a lot"
2,"There is not enough padding in the top of the swimsuit, you could literally see straight through! I am a C-cup and the way this top fit it made me look as if I had no chest at all.

2,"I really loved these sandals. They were great for being around the pool, as I didn't really like getting my leather Rainbow's wet. However, I only had them about 6 months of wearing them only occasionally when the strap broke and these sandals don't have the same warranty as their leather sandals so they would not repair them. The strap came unglued and pulled out of the bottom. I would buy another pair if they were more durable or had the same warranty but they are expensive if they aren't going to hold up longer.",I really loved these sandals
2,"The color and beading is accurately pictured. However, the fit for me (5'4 36c & 40in hips) wasn't a good match. It accentuated my hips in a negative way and it was too big in the top.

Something for everyone to note, I could see my underwear through it- so it would be hard to wear in that sense.",if you have hips- don't buy this dress
2,Its very heavy and the embroidery is very cheap looking with a nylon type yarn. Will return.,Two Stars

2,"First of all, way too small.  It says it fits size 6-12.....no way.  Maybe size 6-8.  Secondly, the thread/yarn it's made out of is very thin and flimsy.  I wouldn't suggest trying to stretch the dress, it would probably rip.  Lastly, you definitely have to were something underneath like a slip.

2,Picture is deceiving. .. they are very plain. There was a greenish coat of something where buckles rest. The heel is very tight. I can see it collapsing  down easily due to the way you push your heel in. The quality of leather however was good.,Not worth the price
2,"I'm confused about the fit. There is no support on the bottom of the shoe. The fit is terrible. The top leg part is way too big, it's too tight around my foot and too big at the toe. Sending them back.",just not for me.
2,"I saw these shoes and wanted to order them because of the seemingly comfortable heel. The heel is comfortable alright. However it is extremely uncomfortable around the toes. I read a review that said they were uncomfortable and could not understand why. I had already worn them and did not feel good returning. I got my husbands shoe expanders to try to make them more comfortable. It helped, but still after an hour or so they start really hurting around the little toe area. They look beautiful on, and if not for toes would be very comfortable.",... and wanted to order them because of the seemingly comfortable heel. The heel is comfortable alright
2,"Zipper bulge!! Love the pattern and the fabric, but the zipper creates massive bulges down the front. I ordered to my size, so it should have fit better! Maybe a large size wouldn't bulge? I never returned it because it's livable--just not super flattering.",Love the pattern and the fabric

2,"Ok it gives the dimensions but unless it's in your hands you reaaaaally don't know how big this bag is.  It is HUGE. SO HUGE it's like one of those cars that doesn't look that huge on the outside but once you get in it's like HOLY COW! So when one puts their stuff in this bag, YOU NEED A FLASHLIGHT to find your stuff.  In the photo it shows that on the side it ""slouches"" a LITTLE bit? See that? On the left?  Well, they must have stuffed this bag for the photo because it SLOUCHES AAAAAALOT!  And so that poofy part that poofs a little . . . is like dragging when you set it down and that is where all your stuff ends up, hiding in corners where you can't see it.  The color is more magenta than a true purple so the photo is accurate.  And ITS A HEAVY BAG!  So if you load your stuff up, it will be like a piece of luggage.  ANd the extended shoulder strap is awkward because one part of the strap latches on to one side of the bag and the other side of the strap latches onto the opposite side on the other end of the bag so it kinda sits funny on your shouler and is not thick enough for the size of the bag because the strap then cuts into your shoulder.  I got this for my mom but she is older and the weight of it was just too much for her to lug around, so she gave it to me and I gave it a whirl, but I hated it so I gave it to someone else who does use huge bags. . . .now she's ok with it, but she puts her iPad, her dayplanner, notebooks and all her ""purse"" like items all in the bag.",ITS BIG AND HEAVY!

2,"I purchased this product based on the look. When the product arrived, I was satisfied, at first. I wore them once, when I travelled to Washington DC. That evening when I returned to my hotel, the my heal was bruised badly and my foot was sore trying to walk to correct the rubbing the back of the shoe did to my heal. There is no padding there and it is very painful to walk long distances in these shoes. I hadn't worn them for a while and then only around the house or to run to the store, but never more than about 30 minutes; until I unpacked them earlier this month and went to NYC. I thought I would give another try to see if the leather had given some and they were broken in. I was sadly mistaken. I put them on to wear in NYC on the 10th of Nov. I badly hurt my knee and my foot was hurting for about 10 days after I returned. The shoes are good to walk around in the yard or run a quick errand, but if you want to enjoy them in cold weather and wear them for more than about 30 minutes, you will have to purchase another pair.",Can't walk a mile.....

2,Ordered these boxers mostly due to style and price. They were entirely too large even for men who have muscular thighs.

The denim is scratchy and has not softened any with washing. There is no stretch whatsoever in the fabric either. And this last problem I will blame partly on my own body shape, but I wanted to give a heads-up to people like me: the front of the shorts are baggy, and the backside is tight.

I'm a size 8, so I can easily fit a medium, but these jeggings in a size large fit more like a small/extra small. I couldn't even get them closed without pulling them way up on my hips (camel toe)! And - muffin top spilling over the waistband - not flattering. As of today, mine is the first review on this product, so I wish I had better things to say. I took a gamble ordering them in the first place. If you're very skinny, these might work for you. If you're a size 4, you could probably fit a large (if your pride can take it).

I wear normal american sizes so I sized up, per the info supplied.  I am also only 5'6''.  It shouldn't be short on me, but it come to the middle of my shins, not at the ankle.

The material the pockets and collar are made if is much softer and more substantial -- I wish the entire shirt was like that. The two pockets on the front are quite large -- and look a bit out of proportion on a size small. And since the pocket material is heavier than the body of the shirt -- they make the shirt look all the more sheer, and the two giant pockets stand out even more.

2,"I ordered the black, white, and beige set along with this set in the same size.  I also purchased a black genie bra from Wal-Mart in the same size for comparison.

Pro: The colors are nice and vibrant.  Very pleasing and fun.  Package came on time.
Cons:  Band is tighter, boob coverage is lacking compared to other colors, triangle modesty pads are too small for the bra size and slide

Genie bra has a reputation of being a comfortable bra; I wanted to have something I could sleep in and wear lounging around the house.  I purchased this package since it was a good price and offered different color choices.  When I tried on the bra, I felt it was a little tighter than I was used to but attributed it to newness.  I left it on for about 1 hour and noticed it was rolling a little.  I left it on a little while longer to see if readjusting the bra would make a difference.  It didn't of course because if these babies are rolling, it's the wrong size.  It started hurting probably after 30 min and I removed it.  I immediately tried the same size from a different package and it fit as it should and covered like it should with no discomfort.

Overall the colors are nice but the fit is not as expected.  If you are like me and are thinking about ordering based on the size you've always ordered, order 1 size up.",Order 1 size up; Expect less coverage

2,"If you order, get ANOTHER size larger than your American size. I lost 57# & wear a size 6. These were still too small.

2,"I mean, it is a pretty watch. That is true. But, for the price, I kinda was expecting a little more. I do not like the Dial numbers printed on the Cristal because it creates a shadow on the inside of the case and you cannot really tell the time if you are looking at the watch from under your eye. And the band feels kinda cheap. Too much plastic. Plus the White color seems very difficult to keep clean; I don't even wanna wear this watch because I feel it will get dirty just by looking at it. The band is not fitting me right; either too tight or too loose. I am still debating whether I am gonna keep it.... :(",Just OK.

2,"The laces are awesome, the lights are cool.  Compared to other light up laces, these keep the shoes tied far better.

The downside?  These things are incredibly fragile.  The electronics stick so it's impossible to turn the lights off w/o removing the battery, thus draining the battery, and the plastic & metal pieces break very easily.  I ordered two sets, and on the first night out, one lace broke (the electrical components, not the lace itself).  Thank goodness I had spares at home, but within a week, another lace is broken.  After 3 weeks, I had only two laces that were even remotely usable, and one of them sticks on and drains the battery.

Despite liking the design, I don't recommend these because they break or don't work too easily.","Practical, but far too fragile."

2,"This wrap was a huge disappointment.
I purchased the L/XL. Ha. Maybe in child sizing. The arm length was ridiculously missed sized. The slits provided for my thumbs was between 1-2 inches above my wrist bones. The end of the sleeve cuffs didn't comfortably reach my wrists. The closure was with one snap in the front that was awkwardly placed. The fullness of the wrap was adequate but the length was short, when I tried it on in front of my family they assured me not to wear it out because the length looked wrong, ended at my back and didn't cover my bottom at all, stood out as ill-fitting.
I have a similar physique as the model pictured wearing the wrap, I ordered the L/XL to ensure an oversized & cozy fit. How could this possibly fit a large woman? The fabric is very soft and I really wanted it to work so I researched if the company sold it in Plus sizes. No. I don't sew but I seriously considered having a seamstress study it to copy it in an adult size for me but found myself so annoyed when I looked at it that I just sent it back in frustration.

2,"I didn't like the boot because the wool lining is only in the neck of the boot which is the area around the ankles. The sole of the foot rests on a suede-like material. The product description did not mention this . I've had Emu boots before and the wool was wrapped inside top to bottom so I was expecting the same here. Since I bought these for cold weather wear they are of no use to me and have been returned.

Some things to note: The neck of the boot is relatively low, only about four inches above the ankle. The boots are narrow, which might be an issue for some, and have a snug fit. The color is a muddy camel. The slight wedge to the inner sole elevates the heel enough that it is noticeable to you as you walk as opposed to regular Emu boots that have a flat sole.",The Boot isn't What I Expected

the initial service was great, they messaged me after I placed my order to ensure that it was the proper size and I ordered one size to big. The leather isn't cheap or luxurious, but fits inline with the price. Lastly, it looks just like it is pictured.
The bad:
There are yellow spots from where the leather is glued and not stitched. It stands out a lot because it's an all white jacket. Then there return policy is even worse! They don't pay for return shipping which is fine, but then they ask you not to use USPS on top of that... so I pay more for UPS, great. Additionally, they charge a restocking fee of 20-50% depending on what the jackets status when they receive it which, for me, is exactly the way I received it. So I'm paying $42.50 (20% restocking and return shipping) because they glued a jacket together and try to sell it for $150... fail.",Some good service but overall not worth the purchase

But the cut and sewing is beyond poor quality.  I am a perfect X small and when I put it onthe rright armhole and the entire right sleeve is much smaller than the left! So my right arm and armhole hardly fits in and not that it has a lot of fabric that you can fix. Then the neckline and all the hems are not aligned properly so if any one looks close the uneven hem shows.

The top part has an inside lining that is a bit odd since it isn't sewn down at the waist (pretty minor complaint and just made it slightly more difficult to get into--it didn't affect the look as far as I could tell).

2,"I guess J-toes and I don't get along. :-(
I don't prefer the way these make my feet look (i.e. huge - I'm a size 8.5) There's something about the way the J-toe tapers on the foot that looks weird to me. Makes your foot look extra long and narrow in a strange way.
As far as the fit, these felt a little too roomy, even with thick socks. I'm an 8.5 across the board in all Ariats, Noconas, Justins, etc. I like a brand new pair of boots to feel a little snug in all the right places before they break in, and unfortunately, I fear once these break in they will be much too large. My feet are normal to narrow, I had *plenty* of room in the toe area and in the instep.
The color is pretty much as it appears in the pic, a light fawn color. The leather soles were a plus and the heel was comfy and stable. Cushioning inside was nice, I have a high-ish arch and I thought the arch support was right on point with most other Ariats.
If they were a snip toe or an L-toe I probably would have kept them.",Comfy but not cute enough

Two weeks after receiving it, a diamond came out. I contacted the company and they told me to ship it back and they replaced it at no charge. This past weekend, I noticed it beginning to warp and two diamonds were missing, one on each side. During the night a prong had actually cut into my ring finger, and that is when I noticed the two diamonds missing. Of course I was very upset and cried. My husband to it to a reputable local jeweler and he placed it under a microscope and showed him where many of the prongs were breaking and barely holding the diamonds in place. He said he cannot be repaired and most likely would continue to break down and lose diamonds. He said he had never seen gold do this.  He couldn't straighten it because it would surely break more.

I am 5'3"" and these come about an inch above my ankles which is perfect for me.

UPDATE: I no longer wear either of these after the first couple times, as lint balls gather galore on them after washing on delicate cycles, and makes them look old and gross. I tried hand washing too.  Balls form particularly if your thighs rub slightly even, and even where your shirt may lightly rub on the top part of the pants.

2,"The shoe has a design flaw with its insole.
After 3 weeks of wearing, the insole started clumping under the foot arch, making the shoe extremely unfomfortable.
The problem is that the insole is made of soft material (spongy base with wool on top) and is attached to the shoe with a dash of glue in the heel only, nothing in the toe. Since the insole is soft and spongy, it allows the front to move around and collect under the arch.
Unfortunately, after the insole clumped up, it does not want to straighten back - all attempts at evening it out work for a very short period of time (like an hour).
The insole needs to be more rigid (like in most shoes) or be glued to the shoe both in the heel and the toe.

Then after about six months of daily use, the cover on the handles started to split and now are revealing a light grey mesh looking fabric.  The bag has never been treated poorly and never over stuffed to cause it to be difficult to carry.  I would expect a bag to last longer than six months before having these types of issues.  Be careful if you plan to use this on a daily basis.","Falls apart quickly, probably not meant for daily use."

2,"Got for my wife. She previously bought a pair (in a slightly different style) and it lasted for years. Unfortunately, the sides where the straps are attached to the sandal tore off within months of wear. These are rather highly priced for flip flops, but her previous pair was worth the money. This pair, not so much. She had to go to a shoe repair store and spend her own money to repair the shoes.

The seller didn't have a larger size.  I don't know how it would have held up to washing and no idea if it would have shrunk.","Runs very, very small."
2,"The fit of this chemise is....weird. It's not that it doesn't fit, because it does, it's just that it fits so unflatteringly. It's snug over my chest and stomach, yet loose everywhere else, which is not at all how it appears in the photo. There is nothing flowy about it; rather, it is boxy and hangs straight down, tending to cling to the body rather than drape. Even if it were larger, it would still have the square shape (although I ordered the 3x which is the largest size so that's a moot point). However, I have received quite a few compliments on the color, which is genuinely lovely, and the terry fabric is very soft, although it is only on the outside of the garment -- what is that about? It would be so cozy to have it on the inside, too.",Disappointing.

Also, if you stretch your arms out with your thumbs in the holes, the arms aren't long enough and it hurts inbetween your thumb and pointer finger. I really wanted to like this for the cowl neck, for I love that design, though it did not sit that way. The neck piece kept slipping down and forward, so it was not as pictured.

The bad- incorrectly sized I ordered and 81/2 and these are a smallish 8 at best, also on the narrow side with a small toebox. Foot bed is a joke at this price, there is zero arch support, no cushioning and little regard for the shape of the human foot.

The sole isn't as soft and supportive, the leather is stiff and there is very little arch support.  I can buy pretty much any Rieker size 39 shoe and know that it will fit me - but not this shoe.

I was shocked at how much the brand has slipped under different ownership. Gone is the awesome Corning glass lenses, replaced by coated plastic. Yeah, these are lighter, but there's no substance, no feel of quality. I honestly wish they had retired the name, but like all new owners, they just want to milk every cent from what was once the best sunglass company on earth.

Back to these: they are decent glasses, and I have three pair. But when they get lost, I won't lament one second, unlike the ones I broke 20 years ago that I still miss. Missed them so much that I paid twice what they cost new for a good used pair. Take that, Bushnell!!","OK sunglasses, but NOT the Serengetis of the 90's"

Unfortunately, however, after several sailing trips in salt water and despite having been thoroughly rinsed and dried before storage, the metal parts at the base of the zipper are so corroded that the jacket can no longer be zipped.

When I tried it on, it was evident that all the buttons would fall off,  most likely the fist time it would be worn.

2,"These shoes are adorable, and the memory foam makes them comfortable. Unfortunately, the back interior seam rubs against the back of my foot a bit, but maybe after I've broken them in that won't be an issue. The biggest problem: They are VERY SLIPPERY on the sole! I nearly slid across my kitchen floor. After examining them, I noticed about  of the sole has a felt-like coating that keeps the rubber from making good contact with the floor. I contacted the seller I purchased these from, and they said it's intentional and not a defect; judge for yourself. Why this was added, I have no idea. If not for the lack of grip on the bottom, I would have given them four or five stars. They look well made, and the lace pattern/ribbon trim is very cute.

So here's the deal. Sole is very ridgid and and the leather is very ridgid as well. They fit rather well for the size ordered, but after a few hours in them you begin to realize that they were made for looks rather than comfort. They are very hard to walk in after awhile or stand in. The upper is much wider than the sole so your foot tends to hang over the edges on each side and make the center if your foot hurt really bad. They look great and if you only plan to wear them about 2 hours and then go home and change them out then they may be ok.

2,"I'm not really good at writing reviews, so I'm just going to do a pros and cons thing.

About Me: I don't work for any backpack companies and I'm not a  ""fanboy"" of any particular brand. Just needed a new pack because my old one was falling apart.

----Pros---
1. Design looks very nice. The color scheme looks very good with the color contrast between the pack and the zipper outlines.
2. It's very comfortable to wear, the straps are wide and the shape of it behind the neck area feels like the weight gets distributed evenly across the shoulders.
3. 33-Liters, it has a lot of room inside the pack for the price it's selling for.
4. Cooling pocket is awesome to hold items that need to stay cool for a while.

---Cons---
1. While the back pack does have 33 Liters of space, the shape of the pack is long vertically, so you won't actually be able to fit many books inside. (Attaching picture with average sized textbooks to show what I'm talking about)
2. Only 3 other pockets beside the main one to store other items. One of the pockets being the cooling pocket and the other is one for sunglasses. The next largest pocket intended for pens and other small equipment is too small to store anything other than those items. A small journal would probably fit in it though.
3. The inside lining feels really thin and lowers my confidence in being able to keep this item for a long time.
4. The pouch to hold a laptop is small, makes inserting a laptop a tight fit. Also, the cushioning around the laptop area is almost nonexistent, so you'll have to be careful if you keep a tablet in there or a thin laptop.

Summary: I really wanted to like this backpack but the design of the Dakine packs having it's main compartment having excess vertical space makes it feel like it was intentionally done to increase the volume of the pack. This backpack would be better suited as a day pack for hikes or other small trips. The name ""Campus"" implies that it was made for a college student though, which this pack wouldn't really be good for someone who's a full-time student. If you're a part-time student and only carry a few items, this backpack still isn't really that good as you're paying more money for the excess volume you'll never use.

Note: Pictures will  be uploaded after I get proprietary software for camera to convert to other formats.",Campus? Only if you don't plan on carrying many items.

2,Good thing that I wanted these for house slippers as they would not hold up to much outdoor use. The insoles are a satiny type material without a firm support and sort of slippery. Very cushiony. No leather anywhere on these. Definitely would not have bought them in a store.,House slippers only.
2,"I had high hopes for these joggers - they look so cute in the pictures. Unfortunately, I got them and they were a bit smaller than I would have liked, but I still wore them because they are soft and cozy. Then after I washed them for the first time, they shrunk even smaller so I couldn't wear them anymore. On top of that, the draw string at the waist pulled almost all the way out during the wash. I should have returned them right away!",Would not recommend

2,Too thin for me. It you have thick hair that kinda puffy or stands up I wouldn't  recommend  it. The material  is really thin and stretchy. When I first purchased  had natural kinda puffy hair. When I tried to cover it you could where my forehead end and haurine begin clearly. Now that I have shaven my head bald my head gets chilly.

Maybe if I had gotten the meduim then maybe it would fit. The shirt was also see through, more like a crochet type top. You would have to wear an undershirt.

2,"Problem is that the boots started separating from the heal and the sole was splitting. This after only a couple of weeks of wear. We had to return them. I have to say this is the second pair of Twisted X boots that I have purchased and it is the last. The first pair I had to pay to have re-soled after about 2 months and the seller wouldn't do anything that far out. These didn't even last that long. The leather upper seems to be very well made but the sole and the stitching to the sole is just sub par. I will not spend this kind of money on another pair of boots that will not last like a pair of Justin boots will for half the cost. Sorry, just being honest. They really need to work on the sole issue. Sad thing is that my son loved these boots, they fit perfectly and he really liked the look and the feel of the leather. It is a shame.","Problems with the sole, second pair. :("
2,"The scarf is adorable, but I HATE that you can see the white elastic all throughout. Since it was Christmas when ordered the packaging was accidentally tossed before I told my husband I was sending it back, so I can't send it back...I tried wearing it, but ended up taking it off. Just can't get past the elastic showing. Makes it look cheap.","The elastic shows, completely ruins the scarf."

2,"I figured for $15 how could one go wrong. This is my second pair of this brand and I am so disappointed! I do not know if its the cheap type of material they use on the bottom, but after wearing this shoe on and off for the last couple of weeks, There is a hole worn in the bottom of each. The material on the sole of the shoe looks like its been worn for months and its only been about 3 weeks. The last pair lasted about 3 months, but sadly the glue no longer held and I noticed the same wear patterns on the previous pair. These are shoes that you may only want to use once or twice for a nice weekend or summer, but for anything more than occasional use, its not worth it.","Cheap quality, sucks cause they are comfy and sharp looking."
2,"Nice , but not for the winter . The left boot is smaller than the right one .",Nope.
2,"Very disappointing money clip.  This piece should sell for about $10.00 at the most.  Corvette logo is so small you need a magnifying glass to read it.  The gap for inserting money is way too wide to clamp on to bills, unless you have a really big stash of money.",Another low quality product

The ones I purchased were worn for TWO work days in a commercial kitchen and the front of the shoe is peeling at the toe. Ive seen Walmart brands maintain their integrity for years! Very shocked and disappointed. Maybe the ones we got are from a bad batch.... On top of it the insoles or the shoe itself doesnt smell right after a day in the kitchen. Ive tried to be open minded but theres no reason why these shoes smell like cat pee even after soaking them in a baking soda and air drying them outside. Again the lower cost ones didn't have an insole so thats why we bought these. Very disappointed in this product. Second star is because they are comfortable and do help with foot and back fatigue, they just don't wear well and smell terrible after a few days.",Insole smells terrible and not as durable as expected.

There are stays in the top like you would find in an old fashioned girdle and the outside of the brief had panels at the back for ""butt lifting/shaping"" and power mesh at the front - it's NOT a smooth material that you would assume a swim bottom would and should be.

2,"Beautiful leather and it looks pretty in the pictures, but it didn't meet my expectations. I should have listened to the other reviewer who said this bag doesn't stand up--the straps make it top heavy, so when you set it down, the tote collapses into itself. I'm just over 5' tall and thought the bag wouldn't be too large--the model must be at least 5'10"" because the tote is as big as my torso! Additionally, for such an expensive bag, there should be an inner lining; unfortunately, I missed the description noting it was not lined, and there are no photos of the inside of the tote (had I read closely or seen photos of the inside, I would have skipped this purchase). The coin purse is flat/thin and would probably fit a couple of liners or a few bills, that's it. Overall, this purchase was a fail.

It has a smell that mirrors some sort of chemical. As for the fit. After a full day of wearing them I was dying to take them off because the back of my heels were rubbing so badly! Funny thing is that they fit my foot size perfectly meaning they were not small nor too big. I find these boots to be rather uncomfortable but hey they were $20 so I didn't expect quality boots. On the bright side, they do look really good with jeans and are very stylish.

2,"So, I've had these shoes for about 3 months, and I am getting rid of them.  I bought them on the recommendation of a trainer I trust, but they just don't live up to the hype.  Sadly, I can't return them at this point, though they are in great shape.  First, though they run a little small in length (I'm usually a 9.5, but had to get a 10 in these), they are very wide.  The material where the logo is would bunch up when I'd walk in them.  It looks terrible, but it wasn't a dealbreaker for me.  I really wanted to like the shoes because they were so highly recommended.  Plus, I loved the colors, needed the shoes, and didn't have time to look for others.  Well, it took me about 6 weeks to realize that they were making my feet hurt horribly (I first just thought it was age-related or maybe I changed the way I was doing something...anything but the shoes!).  I have worn minimalist shoes for years without any pain, but these just made the bottoms of my feet hurt.  Apparently, the sesamoid bones on the bottoms of my feet were smashed to smithereens sometime more than 20 years ago (when I found out about it).  That's when I saw a podiatrist about an unrelated problem, and he said, ""I don't know how you can walk without unbearable pain"" because of the smashed bones.  Well, these are the first shoes I have owned that made me aware of those obliterated bones.  I finally broke down and bought some new Nikes the other day.  My feet instantly felt better when I put them on.  I wore them this morning to work out for the first time, and I didn't give my feet a second thought.",Doesn't live up to the hype

I am a 5'5"" tall, 125 pound woman (small) and I ordered size medium to make sure there was some extra fabric.

Also, both the placid blue and orchid colors were a 4.0 oz poly waffle texture like fabric and the white shirt was a smooth silky light weight 2.8 oz poly blend even though they were all named ""tech silk v-neck."" Basically they are made out of two different fabrics and are called by the same product name. I was willing to keep the white shirt strictly as a base layer because the arms were cut a ""normal"" width even though the lighter fabric was see through.

2,I got a lot of compliments on this bag because of the cute graphic. Too bad the stitching that attached the lining to the outer shell came almost completely apart in a month of not even daily or heavy use.

Somehow I managed to convince myself it looked good enough to wear twice, so it's not COMPLETELY horrible, but I haven't worn it since.

All in all, it may work for someone who is small breasted so you don't have to mess around with the uncomfortable cleavage line.. But you're still going to have to deal with it being cheaply made ( or know how to sew to fix botched stitching). .",Awkward design- not for everyone
2,"The shape of the shoe is awkward, and I couldn't wear it for even one dance. The arch was not supportive for me and even though the shoes are lace up so they should be adjustable, the top cuffs go too high up and dig into my shins.

2,"The texture and leather smell were really nice. The straps are 36"" fully extended, so will only fit an underbust of 33.5"" unless you poke extra holes in it. I didn't get the chance to try that, though because the grommet holding one of the buckles fell apart the first time I unbuckled the belt. Also, one of the the belt-end keeper parts (there are two loops attached to each for holding the end in place when buckled) came unstapled and fell off upon taking the harness out of the bag. So, do NOT get if your underbust and rib cage area below that are greater than 33 inches, as it cannot be altered to fit anyone much larger, and expect to reinforce all the buckles and pieces with stitching or something as it will fall apart.

All that said, if I were small enough for it, I probably would've kept it and tried mending it anyway, because the pleather IS pretty thick and it's a really nice-looking wardrobe item, manufacturing quality issue aside.",Fell apart right out of the bag.

3,"Very nice stylish watch. Would have given 5 stars except for the following:
1. The battery was DOA when I opened the box. I fully expected a working watch as it is brand new. I guess it had been in storage a long time.
2. I have smaller wrists and need to get some links removed. I knew this might be the case, but I've had trouble with getting this done.
3. Caravelle New York's website, and the information supplied by Bolivia with the watch both state that to replace the battery, to go to the nearest authorized dealer. However, every authorized dealer near me refused to change the battery (even though I was willing to purchase one from them) because I didn't purchase the watch from them. Seems store policy trumps Bolivia's policy. So I now have to take the watch to a local jeweler to do this at a higher expense.

Other than that it's a great watch.

I did finally go to a jeweler and had the battery replaced and the band shortened, for only a few dollars. It's now one of my favorite watches. Still gets three stars for the dead on arrival battery.",3 Stars for DOA watch & Update

3,"I just received my glasses in the mail today and I have some pretty mixed feelings about them:

Pros:

-  Build Quality: These glasses are built very well! They could easily rival the quality of the more expensive designer brands that you will find in a LensCrafters or some other optometrist. The frames are light but they don't feel cheap whatsoever. The arms are tight and you don't hear any type of rattle when you're picking them up or moving them around. Also, the arms have a spring hinge

-  Design: Simple yet elegant! The rhinestones add a classy touch without being overbearing. There are no brand names tattooed on the side of the frames. The arms are plastic but they have a discreet marble design to them.

Cons:

-  Really there is just one: The placement of the rhinestones! Several of the rhinestones on my frames were glued on crooked. Now I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist with things that I purchase. However, I do make room for exceptions if Im getting something at a good price. But when you have a product that has a distinctive feature or design (such as these frames, with the rhinestones on the arm), then you need to make sure that the execution of that design is on point. Now, to be fair, the rhinestones are not ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It isn't like there were stones missing, nor does it seem like any of them would easily fall off. Still, you wouldnt want to have someone compliment your glasses, and when they move in to get a closer look they, the rhinestones are looking like a crooked smile.

So while I am quite pleased with the structural quality of the frames, and I would likely order another pair of Aloha eyewear, I am disappointed with how the stones were placed. I picked out this pair specifically for the bling factor and that has let me down. Now there is a chance that you could order the exact same pair and your stones may be placed perfectly  if so, then you have an excellent pair of frames and you got a bargain.

Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","Not the sort of ""Bling"" I was expecting"

The length is perfect for an adult but is sized more for a teen or pre-teen.

I'm 5'4' and 150lbs.  I have given it to my daughter who is 11; but she is as tall as me but wears about a size 3 or a little less in Juniors.

3,"The shoes are very cute and pretty comfortable, however the quality is not what I would typically expect from Puma. The laces are very thin and synthetic feeling, and the elastic loops that hold them are very weak. Also, if the laces aren't tied tight enough it makes your feet look super bloated/odd looking straight on. So of course when I tried to tie them a bit tighter (gently after readying previous negative reviews) 2 of the loops immediately snapped, and a 3rd went just the other day. I expect more to break the more I wear them. I purchased these on 6/20.

For now I've poked holes in the spots where the loops have broken and manually fed the laces through to maintain the stitched look and tight tie. I plan to buy thicker laces and do this with every hole, which will be a bit time consuming, but considering I paid ~$38 for these I can't complain too much, they will still be cute, comfy shoes that I can get some good wear out of.","Cute/comfy shoes, crap quality."

3,"Beautiful watch with lovely leather strap. I love how pretty this is but have to admit that I'm disappointed that it does not actually show the moon phases as I wanted. I love the calendar on it but once I received the watch I realized that it is too tiny to actually read so there's really no reason to include it on the watch.
It does not come with directions on how to set the day and date so I have no idea how to do that. I guess that's not such a problem since I can't read it anyway. It would be nice though to set it and be able to use when I have access to a magnifying glass.",Very pretty but impractical.

Recently, I've noticed that the ones I purchases are more and more worn.  They haven't held up very well at all, the wires are bent and the back elastic is completely stretched out.  I rotate them out with other bras so I haven't worn them enough to have this much wear.  I used to buy Cacique bras from Lane B, and those would hold up for years without stretching out, but I lost weight and couldn't wear them anymore.  I noticed increasing back pain the last few months and after buying some new (different brand) bras it stopped.  These stretched out, non-supportive bras were causing the back pain!  So I guess they are going in the trash.  Very disappointed with the long term quality of this product.",Loved it at first...but it doesn't hold up well....

Correct measurements are: little over 8 feet (96 inches) when fully stretched, including fringes, and a ""usable"" 74 inches. For a 5'8"" person it's very short if you wrap it around the neck.

3,"First, I want to get it out of the way that I really like this bag for a lot of reasons and I am currently carrying it.  I gave it three stars because there are a few integral flaws that are important to point out and that make it a three star review rather than a five star superstar bag.

Next, the bag is not a super soft buttery leather as indicated in the description.  It's a pebbled texture and that isn't an unpleasant thing.  Some reviews on here have mentioned a shoulder strap but it only has the attached strap and no lengthy strap to make this anything other than a hobo.  The decal on the front is really flashy and crystalized.  I don't even notice it anymore but that is mainly because the flap generally falls into the purse instead of over it, which does tend to mar the beauty of the purse.  The reason it does this is despite the purse being roomy, the way the purse is divided and the way the interior pockets are set up makes it inconvenient to keep multiple cosmetic bags, wallets, brushes, etc and I often have these kinds of things in my purse along with a planner and a book of some sort.

The interior of the purse is filled with cheap fabric which is the real deal breaker on what could be a really amazing buy.  For the price point I would expect a close to designer quality of fabric and this is really inexpensive material with stray threads and rough material.  Some minor tweaks could make this bag so amazing but it just falls short in every category.  Overall, for half of what it's sold for it's a great bag.

I purchased this J & B women's hobo handbag at a deep discount so I could offer my unbiased and honest review of it. I know some people are wary of people who receive discounts. All opinions are truly my own and it is my pleasure to be able to offer others my thoughts so they might be able to make informed decisions as to whether products are appropriate for them.",A just miss handbag

3,"There are two problems with these shoes for me, and I've had the issue with both the vegan and the regular suede styles.  First is that the texture tends to rub for me and I can develop blisters if I'm walking at a brisk pace somewhere instead of leisurely walking from room to room in a building.  Second, I don't usually have much issue with feet smell, but these tend to reek after a couple hours.  I've been trying various things to cut the smell, using lavender essential oil seems to help, but requires I apply it whenever I intend to wear them, and can end up being overwhelming.  Everything I've tried requires constant reapplication, though, and I've never had this issue with sandals before, so I find it frustrating.

One other thing to note is that they all tend to come a little tight, and I have had to wear them for a couple days to loosen them.  But the vegan leather comes tighter than the regular suede and stays a little tighter, too.  I have wider feet so I was concerned at first, but both styles end up wide enough not to cause me discomfort.

For me, the arch support is great, but I don't really require a lot of support.  I find them very comfortable to wear for daily use if I'm not going to take a walk.  Mostly I like a little bit to help fatigue if I'm going to be standing a lot.  And I like the way they look; they are dressier than the plastic flip flops I had, so they go a bit better with skirts.","the arch support is great, but I don't really require a lot of ..."

The shoe seems to run small. Normally  I wear an 8, and I have multiple pairs of a much older Merrell Glove -- both the old slip-on and the Mary Jane styles, all in size 8, all absolutely awesome.  I got hooked on the Glove with those old styles, and I wish Merrell still made them!  I sized up a 1/2 size for this, to accommodate a thicker sock, but it's still tight across the foot, though the toebox is roomy enough.  I have to let the laces out to their maximum looseness.  If not, my foot starts to go numb.  I much prefer the old slip-on Glove to this, but definitely this new sole is slightly more robust than the old Glove -- possibly due to the ""Trail Guard"" feature?","Pretty good for long day hikes, but runs small and can barely tie the laces"

3,"I have had Casio Watches since I returned from Japan in 1977.  I had bought a Seiko digital watch and the display gave out after only three years.  So I searched for a good replacement and came across Casio.  I have worn Casio databanks and digital watches ever since.  My last Casio Watch started having issues after only 4 years.  When I went to replace the battery, I was careful but still unable to get it to work properly.  The inner casing was a nightmare to remove and I remember that with my last model even the jeweler struggled to replace the battery.  I began searching for another Casio, but this time I was cautious as my 10 year battery only went just short of 4 years even though I hardly ever use the backlight.  I was looking for a silver digital watch with a timer function and a fold over clasp rather than the nightmare bands that require removal of pins to resize them.  Very few Casios have the countdown timer anymore.  Finding a silver digital watch with a countdown timer and a fold over clasp proved to be nearly impossible.  The Casio watch selection is no longer what it used to be as there are many confusing combinations of watchbands and features.  Since the Casio watch model number has no relation to the module number that describes the watch features and how to use them, I was pretty much out of luck.  I stumbled across this model and some said it had a countdown timer and others said no.  In addition, the Amazon seller did not offer Prime shipping.  Without the module number, I could not tell for sure whether it had a countdown timer.

Finally exasperated, I ordered a Skmei World Time Watch.  The map display just alternates and does not give individual time zones, but it does have the settings to display the time zones in the mode selection.  What really sold me on the Skmei was that it was half the price of the Casio and you could get information about its features.  Amazingly enough it does not have a cheap backlight but rather the LED display itself lights up with the time!  Casio, why doesn't your watch have this great feature?

As a 40 year Casio watch owner, I miss the Casio brand.  But for half the price and with the observation that my Casio's had not been living up even remotely to the advertised battery life, the innovative LED backlit numerals of the Skmei were just too much to pass up.  I hope that Casio wises up and updates their website to show all the watches available, adopts the LED backlit display, and gets realistic about their battery life claims.  I also hope they have both the Model number and the module number listed in their descriptions to help verify the watch's features and how it works.  It saddens me that a great company like Casio is not properly promoting and making their product line information available.  It just cost them a long time customer.",Casio lost a customer due to lack of readily available information and poor battery and product life

3,"For the price, this swimsuit in multiple colors is a good buy. However its not perfect. The bottom generally fits nicely. If you have very large breast you may have an issue with the top. In this particular picture, the straps on this model are thick which WOULD be great if that was the case because it would provide great support for large breast. However thats not the case. The straps are thin. There is another swimsuit on Amazon just like this but only comes in blue and pink...I have that one two and it runs a little bigger than this one.

I have a narrow foot, but this shoe squeezes my ""toe knuckles"" something awful. The entire toe box is very small, and I NEVER have a problem like this with shoes. It really is gorgeous, but I can't wear it anywhere but my desk job, and I can't wear it two days in a row.",Gorgeous but VERY Narrow

3,"First the ad indicated that the suitcase is polycarbonate when it is in fact ABS. Regardless of the exact plastic, it is a pretty good case. I travel every week, so I have had many cases over the years. Unlike the new Frameless polycarbonate suitcases, this case rolls more smoothly because it and aluminum frame that makes it more rigid. In about four months, I thought that this would end up being my longest lasting case because it was showing less wear than any other case that I could remember. That changed when the American Airlines baggage handling bent the frame of the case. When I showed the case to AA, they told me that they are not responsible for dents. I guess that they consider bending the frame a dent. I brought the case to a luggage repair shop who told me that the case was beyond repair. So the bottom line is that while the case held up very well, it only took a single incident that the airline that handled my bag does not take responsibility for to turn the bag into scrap. If American Airline took responsibility for the damage and gave me a replacement, I would get the same case because I liked it. But the fact that they do not take responsibility for the case ending damage makes this relatively inexpensive case an expensive case to own.",Very nice until damaged

3,So Purchased this for my wife and the dress was everything she expected but we quickly learned the fabric by the zipper was screwed up and it caused the zip to bind and have gaps while zipping up. Amazon returned it without any issues. I gave it a three star to just warn people this could happen and do not order it if you have an event or something the day you get it.

  102cm hips 40in.
  68cm thigh 26.7in.
My stomach is small, but I have big legs, and an actual butt. I got 34, hoping they would be more of a relaxed fit on me. The waist is a tiny bit baggy. I can fit both my hands (in a fist) down the pants, but the legs are super tight. I would not be able to run in these, and I fear lifting my leg any higher then a standard staircase step.

Packaging: It was decently cushioned in a bubble mailer.

Contents: One hat and one smiley face button. The extra gift (the bunny cubes) was not included in my package as it was for other buyers.

Comfort level: Maximum. This hat is incredibly comfortable. It stretches, so it does not squeeze your head when you wear it. It fits easily over a wig.

Durability: All the materials are thin, so you have to handle the product with care.

Item condition: All right. The hanging braids were a little frayed, but it didn't detract from its appearance. The button also had a tiny dent in it, but it isn't terribly noticeable.

Overall thoughts: It's a bit pricey for its quality. The price should be halved in my honest opinion.",Perfect for Noiz cosplayers

She is a 2yr old so I was a little worried it would fit her tummy, being the shape the dress is. But it fits great. The gathering on the skirt is cute but needs to be fluffed out a bit.

I personally wish it could be worked to be used more casually, and I was kind of hoping that when I purchased it, but what ever. Price isn't bad for a 'party' wig. Not keeping it.","Beautiful Color and Hair Thread Quality, but Looks Fake."

In fact, it is not as heavy as I thought it would be. However, the second hand does not align with the minute markers. I tried my best to overlook it but it just stood out too much for me. I've attached a video to illustrate this. In it I've included an old Timex Quartz Chronograph for comparison. If a less expensive quartz watch can hit its markers, then it's not unreasonable to expect a 300 dollar watch to do the same.

This is actually the second time I've bought and returned this watch. The first order had the same problem and I thought it was just bad luck. I returned it and since I liked the watch so much, I ordered a second one only to encounter the same issue again. To be fair to Seiko, maybe the seller, Click-&-Buy, have a bad batch of these watches. I wouldn't know for sure though because they (the seller) ignored my queries.

Lastly, I would just like to comment about Amazon fulfillment. I'm no longer surprised to see items insufficiently packed but it's the first time I've seen an item that did not have any cushioning at all. (see attached picture) And we're talking about a watch here, not a piece of clothing or a book.",Second hand not aligning with markers

3,"I like the vest itself a lot. But I was really disappointed (and a little shocked) when I received this to find that it has an outdated zipper, that does not hook correctly .. it takes a lot of jiggering. The zipper is very small and metal and catches on the surrounding fabric, like something out of 1975!

I did not know that ANY clothes were still being made with small, metal zippers that grab the surrounding fabric, or that require you to jam the tang into the heel. If you do not apply force when setting the zipper or take care to make sure the surrounding fabric is not hooked it will either Jam, or unhook from the bottom!,.. UGH!,.. The zipper is horrible. Really stupid design choice. Why does this model have an outdated zipper?

I really like the Scottevest brand and even purchased the ""lightweight"" vest and it has a modern zipper, with large nylon teeth like you would expect.

But for some reason, Scott has made this one with an outdated and sploogy zipper..

not cool.","Nice Vest, Horrible Zipper"

It's  a bit overwhelming for my personal head and my personal style. I know that it would work if my hair were at  least 3 inches longer..... and then I would fill up the hat.

3,"I LOVE Kate Spade, but I was a little disappointed when I received this. I bought the Lacquer Red and the red is perfect, but what I wasn't expecting was the bright PINK inside! No where in the description (at the time I am writing this) does it say that, and only after going through the pictures again, can I see a hit of pink. But I wouldn't have seen it unless looking for it. So just be warned that the red had a pink inside, and the black has a Tiffany blue inside (from what I can tell in the picture).
My other complaint about this product is that the stitching on one side has started to come undone. It's in a minor spot, so not a huge deal, but when you buy Kate Spade, you expect better from her. I had not been using it strenuously; it never got caught on anything. It just started to come undone after about 2 weeks.

I can wear them for a long period, but I can't walk in them very long.  Heel way too high.  I thought the description was exaggerating a bit.  Most items are always much smaller, lower, or more expensive looking than they really are.","Nice shoe, but too high!"

3,"I love that these mittens are very warm, super fluffy on the inside, and make it easy to access my phone. However, they took almost a month to arrive (shipped to the US from Britain) and I immediately noticed that the stitching between the thumb and forefingers was already becoming undone.

Also the heel part of the shoe digs into my daughters skin, so she needed bandaids after wearing for a day.  Finally, it doesn't give my kid a lot of grip during active play.  I noticed that her feet were slipping out from under her while on playground equipment, so this is not the shoe I prefer to have her wear on a regular basis.

3,"This bathing suit fits exactly as expected. It does not run smaller or larger. I usually wear a size 10 and ordered a 12, and while it fits well dry, when wet it's a little big. A size 10, (my usual size), would have been ideal. I have to keep the removable strap on at all times because it won't stay up on its own. I also feel the size 10 would have had more tummy control. I am 5'4 and 140 lbs. I am evenly proportioned. The bathing suit is made well and good for the price. The one defect is on the left side where the strap hooks to the bathing suit, the hook will not go in the correct way and has to be turned around and hooked through backwards. I will wear it to the Y, and in my personal pool at home, but not any pool partis by any means. Since it's a tad large when wet and the strap cannot be trusted, let alone the bathing suit on its own. Really don't feel like flashing anyone.",Fits as expected! Strap does not hook well. Other than that its a good bathing suit

3,Runs a 1/2 size too small,Runs smal
3,Cute suit and definitely hides the mid-section.  I probably could have gone a smaller size b/c the middle was pretty baggy. I actually ended up tying it on the side just to make it a little more fitting.  I also wore black bottoms instead of the pink.

Also, shirt hidden-interlocking some loose, no spare hidden-interlocking. Unlike Diesel, consider very comprehensive details.","Too close, unfortunately I am not a very thin model."

Everything else about the bag was great. The artwork was simply gorgeous. I really wish it had been larger, or at least the top part be part of the bottom part so it has a large pocket in the center. As it is, the small pocket at the top is too small to even use for anything. It winds up being a decoration and that is about it. I really wanted to like this bag, but it's simply too small for me. I had some specific items I wanted to put in the bag, and they would have fit if the dimensions accurately reflected the size. I am returning it.

3,"After nearly 6 months using this bag, I can say that I appreciate the padded laptop compartment. The top straps that snap together with metal buttons and act as a sort of handle, never stay snapped together unless I carry nothing in the bag. The net side pouches for my water bottle, has strangely become difficult to clean while living in a tropical environment that is apparently subject to fast growing mold. The bottom section for your gym shoes are good for a quick transport only but does not have ventilation so you definitely need to air out any towel or shoes you carry in that compartment. Lastly, and sadly, I discovered that this bag is in fact not waterproof. If I'm biking in the rain, I'll line the bag interior with a plastic bag since I found that water seeped onto my notebooks leaving them wet from the bottom meaning the shoe compartment was the first to go in a downpour.",It's Okay but mostly for show

3,"I purchased the grey saude shoe with the yellow accent on the heel.
I like the look of the top of the shoe, it's a clean simple look.  The splash of yellow gives the shoe a bit of character and color.
Aesthetically, the shoes look like a cool skating shoe.

There isn't much arch support in the shoe, but it's got decent cushioning.  My issue is the shoe is a bit short.  The shoe is a bit chunky (width wise) but that's to be expected with a skate shoe.  But even after ordering a half size up, my foot hits the front of the shoe.  It's a bit uncomfortable, but it's bearable.

So far I've had them for a few months and they've help up great.  Granted, I don't skate in these shoes but I wear them often and I've fairly active.

The product description says they are acrylic knit but the tag says they have wool and alpaca too.  They are soft and not scratchy at all.  The only problem I have found is that they are a little snug.  I have small hands and my ring size is 4 3/4 and these are small.  I'll still wear them and hopefully they'll stretch out a little bit.  The finger holes are tight and the flip over part is short too.  I'll use them for my commute but when it's really cold I think I'll have to go for something warmer as these are relatively light weight.,Cute but runs small
3,"A good fitting jean for the ""pear"" shaped gal!  True jean material and great coloring!  I will say that the ""bling"" doesn't last.  They fall out easily; however, sometimes they just come half way out and they will poke you, even draw blood on occasion, the fasteners are that sharp.  Also on both pairs that I bought (different colors), the waist button is a big bling and not secured well at all, first the bling falls out of the fastener.  Then the fastener comes unglued after a few washes.  I've had to sew a large button onto them because the fastener leaves a large hole.  They are a ""skinny"" jean and fit snug.","A good fitting jean for the ""pear"" shaped gal"

3,"**Update: Although I still think it is a very cute shoe and have gotten several compliments on it,  the strap has caused me some difficulty.  I wear pantyhose  whenever I dress up  and the strap easily slides off.  I added heel grips, which are well hidden by the thick strap.  But it's still slides off.  Also, the toe sharply points which makes it tight front.  I have wide feet  so I cannot stand in the shoes long.  There is not much give to the leather.

Knowing this was a China deal, was scared it would be way too small, so ordered up two sizes - XL.  I measure 89 cm chest, ordered the XL for 100 cm.  I'm 5'2"", 124 lbs. by the way <You can do an online inches to cm conversation to help you know what is the right size for you>. Anyway, the XL is big for me, but think this will make a nice gift.  I just ordered the Med for a fitted look, will see how it goes.

1/3/15 - So I finally received the M. Apparently they shipped it to another person who was then instructed to send it to me (was this a return or did they really send it to the wrong person?). In shipping twice however the coat developed deep creases. The sellers recommended Sheep skin oil and said they would refund $6. I kind of doubt this will fix the problem and not happy I have to deal with it.  Also, they changed the sizing system, it used to be in cm and you could figure out your size but now they have done away with that... and the M is also too big.

Our problem with these is that after just a couple months of use, the purple ""stripes"" that you can see between the ""N"" and the toe of the shoe, began peeling off. They peeled at the top and just hung down. Ours were only attached at the top and bottom to allow the shoe to flex and breathe. But this was very unsightly. I tried several different types of adhesive and glue (super glue, hot glue, gorilla glue etc) and could not get the top of those stripes to stay attached to the sneaker. It is a shame because the sneakers were holding up great otherwise. It just looked stupid having the stripes hanging down flapping off the side of the shoe. It only happened to the front outer stipes on the two sneakers. Otherwise I think these would have been great shpes that would have lasted our daughter quite a while.",We liked these.

3,"I own a variety of carhartt products, and although sizing can be a shot in the dark, they're typically tough as nails. as a stonemason I typically get a year of tough use and abuse out of a pair of double knee dungarees. Their shirt jacs have been equally as tough. This is not a shirt jac, at least not compared to the shirt jacs offers by Carhartt in the past. I'm certain this would not last a month under hard working construction conditions. The material and color combo seems like its very stain prone. The shell being 3.75 oz feels fragile. It is fleece lined which is very comfortable and I hope they incorporate that into more of their products if they haven't already. In my opinion it's one of the more stylish patterns they've produced and I hope to see more styles like it. The claim of being able to dry faster than I sweat will remain unproven as I wil never wear this to work. As far as fit goes, I'm 5' 10"", 190 lbs and a medium fits well, but a hair long. its no tailored fit, but it doesnt fit like a mumu either. Relaxed would be accurate.

3,"This necklace ended up being just okay for me, but for the right person, I can see this being 4 or 5 star worthy.

In my case, the issue is the way the chain and extender chain segment are designed.  If you look at the photos I've attached, you'll see that I've laid it out on the table TWO ways:  one photo shows the necklace connected at the end of the regular chain, before the start of the extender chain, and the other shows the necklace connected at the end of the extender chain, at maximum length.

The problem is that you really have no choice but to use the extender, whether you want to or not, because that's the only way the clasp can be positioned directly behind your neck at the ""12 o'clock"" position.  If you didn't use the extender, the clasp is then positioned at ""10 o'clock,"" which is an awkward place for it to sit on your neck, especially with the rest of the extender hanging down. (See photos below.) If you wear your hair up, it's going to look like you necklace is permanently crooked from the rear.

The little charms are cute, and the chain is good, though.  In terms of quality, it's nice. I think it looks best with a long ""Y"" tail, but the longer you want to make that tail, the more the clasp becomes offset from the back of your, centered at ""12 o'clock.""  It's a little difficult to explain--so I hope I've done a decent job of describing the issue.  Again, for the right person, this will be a  higher-rated product---many people won't care about the back of the necklace.  For me, I want things to be centered properly so I don't have to worry about them during the day---which is why I'm only giving this item 3 stars.  However, that won't deter me from happily purchasing other designs---I already bought the ""Circle"" necklace for my sister, in Gold, and liked it so much that I'm thinking about getting another for myself.

3,"Material is a wee bit thin, I don't think I'd recommend them to anyone.",so-so
3,"So, let's get the good stuff out of the way; the things that earned it what stars there are. First, you can't really beat the price. less than thirty bucks for an adult men's athletic shoe that looks good in multiple situations. The top of the shoe is a tiny bit snug, but that might just mean the laces need loosening. The shoe looks good, and when I first put them on and stand in place, they feel good. I have worn Avia in the past and was happy with them.

Unfortunately, these particular shoes come with memory foam soles (or Memory fOm with a line over the O, perhaps ""memory foam"" is something else that they can't claim these contain?), and they do. Not. Want. To stay in place. I have had the shoes for a little over 24 hours, and I've had to readjust the soles FIVE TIMES. And bear in mind, 8 of those 24 hours I was asleep and not wearing the shoes. Also, these are ostensibly athletic shoes, but the soles keep slipping (when taking them off and on, and just while wearing them), and all I've done is walk around a bit. I walked out to my car, to my car to the office, around the office here and there, from the office to my car, and from my car to my home. (Oh, and a stop at a gas station in there). Not exactly an athletic regimen. Yet the memory foam soles wouldn't stay put. Twice at work I had to literally take my shoes off at my desk just to fix one of the soles because it had somehow slipped backwards until the bottoms of my toes were just touching the bare shoe past the sole. I have had cheap store-bought odor eater type inserts with more traction and stability than these. They wouldn't be so bad if they were affixed to the bottom inside of the shoe somehow, with glue or tape or velcro or SOMEthing. As it is, I will probably keep the shoes but replace the soles with something from the store, because despite this hangup, I still can't really beat the price. It's a shame, though, because the star rating would have been a 4 or 5 otherwise. And again, this is pretty much Day One. Who knows how I'll feel in a week or a month.",Would have rated it higher if they used an ordinary sole that stayed in place.
3,"This is a very good shoe.  It is comfortable and well made.  I'd give it 4 stars if that is what I bought them for.

However I bought them because of the ""ice lock technology"" hoping that they would be better on ice than my Doc Martins.  They might be marginally better in this regard, but they don't live up to the claim.  I'd give them 2 stars for ice gripping.",Ice Lock Technology is nothing to rave about.
3,The Beard works but its itchy and doesnt stay on very well if you are doing a lot of talking or singing. If you don't have a large head there is a good chance that you will have to tie the straps in order to get the beard to fit properly.,If you don't have a large head there is a good chance that you will have to tie the straps ...
3,Runs very small.  Just okay for my grandson.,Runs very small. Just okay for my grandson.
3,Shirt is comfortable and great quality. I did order a size up based on other reviews. The only issue I have is that the shirt still fits small in the bust and I'm only a B cup. I'm currently a 36 B bra size and medium (size 6 or 8) shirt and dress size so for the bust portion to be such a snug fit in a large was unexpected.,Great quality bough fits very snug in bust

Also, it's not very wide for a plus size.  I'm a 14-16 and I could get into it, but it would be too tight for a size 20.  It's beautiful but I had to send it back.  I wish designers would realize that the average American woman is short and fat (about 5'3"" and 165 lbs.).  I hate when they assume Plus size means large all over, like a giant Amazon female warrior.  No, the average is SHORT and FAT.  If you're going to make Plus sizes for tall large women, then you need to also make Plus Petite sizes (what an oxymoron) for short fat women.",Made for tall women

 We bought two jackets to be use by my son and husband while working in the woods during hunting season. They used them for 6 hours walking in very rough terrain ( thorn bushes, trees) .

I'm two months postpartum and I've got a bad separation in my stomach muscles and I bought this to help them heal back together, and it does a decent job, the back does fold over while I wear it and it takes a little fiddling to get the Velcro to line up so that my stomach doesn't get scratched up.",because it's not horrible but it's not great either

I had ordered this bra, excited to see if this was ""the one"".  I was slightly disappointed when it arrived, finding that this bra boasts some heavy lining (which in truth, is more like a padding... as if bustier ladies really want or need any more help in that area)... and the thick lining of this bra makes the cups the smallest bit too small to fit me without any spillage.

Had this bra been offered in one cup size larger, I may have considered it.

The only thing I had an issue with is that it didn't include the wristbands or headband in my package like its suppose to. That definitely wouldve completed my outfit for the 80s party Im attending. And for the price, Id want everything included as advertised. Now I have to go to a store last minute to buy some.",Buy a size down

It served it's purpose. The only thing that I had a genuine problem with was that the fact that it would ride up on my back as well as it was a little tight on my neck. It wasn't like this until I started to move around a lot. Since I am a first time rash guard wearer, I ruled it over as maybe that's what they do since I fell (a lot) off my paddleboard but I also purchased one from Speedo and it didn't do this.

Then realized that the fabric composition is entirely different. 7 yrs wilderness is 98% cotton and the denim is more traditional type (thicker and doesn't really stretch). Which I thought I liked. But, nowadays I am so used to stretchy denim and more figure hugging fit, this pair fits somewhat loose and feels like old days... sort of like boyfriend jean but not really. It's hard to describe! Just be aware that even though the cut style (Stilt) is the same, it doesn't fit like the pair made with 70% cotton.

As far as criticisms, they aren't well made. I've only worn these a few times and the stitching is unraveling. At this point the entire tip of the thumb on one of the gloves is open. Thankfully, I live in Phoenix so it's not a huge deal. I can stitch them up when I get the opportunity. But much colder and that hole might become a problem. I don't hate them enough to return or exchange them, mostly because that whole deal would leave me without gloves for a few nights and meh. But they are pretty much OK.

I have a very high arch in my foot and the arching in the heel just did not match up which also contributed to the discomfort.

I was able to buy one of those eyeglass kits and fix it, but there was no warranty and even emailed the vendor on amazon.  So I fixed them myself.  They work.

3,"Okay, so full disclaimer: I didn't buy this through Amazon, and when it arrived, it appeared to have been previously opened, and didn't work, so consider this review accordingly.

First let me say that, as you probably can already tell, the MSRP on this watch is hilariously inflated, part of the oldest marketing trick in the book to make you think you're getting value on a sale price. I seriously doubt anyone's ever bought one for the ""full"" price, and even the ""sale"" prices should be considered suspicious. I paid roughly 10% of the MSRP through an online clearinghouse, and all things considered I believe that, had it worked when it arrived, it would have been an okay deal given the price I paid. I bought two other watches from Heritor in the $100-$150 range (marked, allegedly, ""80-90% off""), and they both, so far, seem to have been decent buys for the money. Mechanical watches aren't cheap, and Automatic Skeleton watches even less so. There is very little middle ground between worthless crackerjack box plastic knockoffs, and a Rolex that costs more than a used car and you put in your will. Obviously, you're not looking at this watch if you can afford to drop several grand on a Rolex, so be that as it may, this may be a watch worth considering for you.

The following is based off my experience with one of the other, similar model Heritor watches that arrived in working order, and may or may not be 100% accurate for this particular watch:

The movement is a fairly standard inline lever escapement from China (although Heritor claims that the movement from at least SOME of their watches comes from Japan), and so far (having worn one for a few days) seems reasonably reliable and accurate. Heritor's website provides more specific mechanical details of each model, but you really can't trace the movement to any particular make of any particular notoriety. The Day of Week and Day of Month complications (in the watches that have them) appear to legitimately function, although the Month indicator is manually advanced at best. The Automatic winding wheel works as advertised as well. The watch face does have a quality look to it, although some of Heritor's designs and colorations can be gaudy or difficult to read. The leather watch bands they come with are garbage, but replaceable--while they do appear to use genuine leather on the outside, the layer is thin, and thickness is given by a middle layer of foam. This makes it brittle enough to not withstand years or even months of buckling and unbuckling. If you like the band, wear it until it breaks, then replace it, otherwise just replace it right away with a metal band. I would not expect this watch to be durable. Don't wear it in the shower, or drop it, or wear it while working on things where you might be banging it up against things. If you think you can take good care of it though, and you enjoy wearing and looking at a mechanical skeleton watch, you may get your money's worth at least... but seeing as how you can't afford a Rolex now, I wouldn't expect you'll be able to afford one when this wears out or breaks, either.","Don't believe the MSRP, but for the right price you could do worse."

3,"I ordered this dress on the 10th for my daughters 9th birthday for her to wear at her party on the 19th. The dress did not arrive in time so I printed a picture of it to give to her, but the whole point was for her to wear it at the party. When it finally did arrive the initial first sight of it we thought it was beautiful. Probably the most beautiful Elsa dress we had seen yet. Until she tried it on. The seems weren't sewn very well so after only a few wears, for short periods of time, it had started to rip at the seems in the waist. The sleeves were to short, so she wasn't able to put the finger loops around her fingers to hold the sleeves in place. The length of the overall dress however was on point. The cape was beautiful, and really added the perfect touch to the Elsa look she was going for. The crown was just ok. When she wore it to another Frozen event she ended up wearing a different crown because it just didn't look like Elsa's crown form the movie. We did like that it zipped in the back instead of Velcro like other dresses we were considering. The sequin top and silk bottom set it apart from the other common Elsa look alike dresses so when my daughter wore it she felt unique compared to the other dresses. We purchased it at a discount because we received a credit for signing up for the amazon credit card and we used the credit on this item. If I had paid the full price that it was selling for I would probably have been upset by the quality for the price. My daughter on the other hand LOVED it despite the flaws. She had finally gotten her Elsa dress so I don't think she had the same expectations I had. If your purchasing for an event that it will only be worn once or twice, its a good purchase. If your purchasing it to be around for awhile, it may fall apart after heavy use.",When it finally did arrive the initial first sight of it we thought it was beautiful.

3,"Was larger than expected.  Too bad, it is a pretty color.",Will have to return
3,"*****UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS USE******
I KNOW WHY THESE FIT TOO TIGHT. So it appears that the insole is just way too thick for these boots. I replaced it with an insole from my (alternate between) house shoes and some old sketchers I have. They fit perfectly without it. The insole literally adds nearly half of an inch of height within the shoes, which makes it painful to walk in. Also, these shoes are super rare and I receive a lot of compliments on their color. I still think its a beautiful boot.
P.S.
I live in a place where 4ft of snow and 5 degree wind chill is just a normal winter. These work PHENOMENAL in cold weather with thick socks.

>Original Review<
I've never had a pair of Timbs that fit smaller than the printed size. If anything, timberland is infamous for its ""runs big"" approach to shoewear, which makes sense because it allows for thick socks to be worn with thick shoes. However, I generally wear between a 8 and 9, with 8.5 being the majority of my shoes. So I figured 8.5 would work. False.

I tried the shoes on with thin and thick wool socks, and wore them all day (today actually). They are beautifully crafted and the soles and foot arc support is actually better than expected. But the shoe is narrow near the toes and foot joint. So narrow that it feels like your foot is being crushed with every step. I will try a size 9 (whaaaaaaaaat) with these. Hopefully it will work. Again, the shoe is angelic but it fits like a demon.",ORDER A HALF-SIZE UP <- YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY
3,"These shoes are so freakin cute! I ONLY wear flatform shoes, and I'm very comfortable with wearing shoes in this height. My main issue with the shoes were how heavy they were. They are not lightweight like platforms are suppose to be made (even my 3 inch rubber heel Doc Martens are lighter weight), and it feels like dragging bricks around. I have many platforms, and all of them are very comfortable in comparison.

 The laces are also really cheap, so they come undone -- especially when the weight of the shoes weigh them down -- the laces seem to loosen even when I double knot. Also, I wore them around the house for 30 minutes to test out the fit, and they gave me blisters at the heel. Wear THICK socks when breaking them in. I'll be returning them because they aren't easy to walk in.",CUTE but uncomfortable.

Normally a skirt would be symmetrical going around the thighs, but instead as the skirt goes around your bottom, it starts to lift smack in the middle and cannot be pulled down. It forms an upside down V which reveals your underwear and looks like you have a one piece bathing suit rather than a mini dress. It's just really odd.

3,"This is a stunning medallion, but I have given it three stars instead of five because I don't think the price point is right for the visual quality of the piece, and it doesn't ""read"" as 18K gold.

Pros:
1. Interesting visual, with the two tones of metal (gold and gunmetal) and the sparkling CZs
2. Large! about 2 inches in diameter. This is part of it being a striking piece
3. Sterling and gold plated officially warrant the expense
4. The chain is delicate, but surprisingly strong for its size... I really like the chain
5. The chain also has an extender -- two inches of larger loops, so that you can change the length from 18"" to 20"".
6. The stunning presentation box was unexpected. It's black with bright blue lining (on the outside box) and ribbon tabs (on the inside box). The box is roughly 3""x4""x2.25"", so much larger than it needs to be, but again, it's also a lovely box.

Cons:
1. The gold doesn't ""read"" as real gold... it reads as gold-colored. This is a subtle thing, but it's what kills the piece (for the price point), that the quality of the metal looks like something you'd get in a mall store. The back in particular looks like a cheap coating. One wonders whether ""gold plate"" doesn't actually apply to the whole pendant.

Suspicious:
1. Stampings on the back of the medallion are: ""CX 925"", ""CHINA"", and ""PAJ"".
2. Stampings on the chain are ""PAJ 925"" and ""CHINA"".
Note that there are no stampings that indicate gold content, not even ""GP"", which I think would be ""18K GP"" for this piece.

Another suspiicous thing for me is that sterling silver is a soft metal, and this is a very stiff piece.

Indifferents / for you to decide:
1. Mine has a defect; some of the gold is covering some of the gunmetal in the center. I am not putting this in the ""cons"" because Amazon customer service is the best anywhere, and if something is wrong, they will work with you to fix it.
2. Made in China, something that I myself am not fond of.

I have other jewelry from the Amazon Collection, and it's wonderful (including gold plated silver that ""looks right""), so I think this piece is just off.","Stunning, but doesn't have the appeal that gold plate over sterling usually does (= overpriced)"

The hair is just tied back, and it's a short ponytail, which makes me pretty said because I wanted it long like in the pictures. (Mine came with no clip at all, not in the bag or on the wig)And with the cap being small, with whatever wig I was provided, if anything, the cap is too Big, which isn't a problem because it can be adjusted, I'm just sad that the pony tail aspect isn't anything that I read about..
But the actual quality of the wig itself is nice. It can take low heat on a straightener, looks natural in normal lighting.

3,"This beanie didn't fit quite as I'd hoped. It's more of a long, narrow tube instead of rounded. So when you put your locs up in it, you end up with a weird tubular look at the back of your head.

Lume is typical at this price point/not good but usable. The good? The watch is good to look at. The open heart design is really an eye catcher and I have had a few compliments on it in only two days of wear. I put a couple of different nato straps and that really makes it pop.

3,"Just ok, not at all the great supportive fit I've come to expect from Avia. First of all, there's a ton of extra fabric inside, like where the tongue is stitched to the shoe. It was all weirdly lumped up, so I took my small scissors & clipped it all evenly. It took 10-15 minutes per shoe to do this, there was such a mess inside. More importantly, the insoles are a JOKE. First of all, very thin & offer absolutely NO SUPPORT. If you have a high arch pass on this shoe. Second of all, they don't stay put at all. I literally had one slide down under my foot during a 5 hour shift, so at the end of the shift it had gone up the back of my pant leg. Not kidding. My coworkers laughed their butts off when I reached down & casually pulled the insole out, which was only hanging by the tip of the toe area between my heel & back of the sneaker. Now the really bad part of the insole: holy COW these things make my feet stink! I have never EVER never had smelly feet, whatever this insole is made of is insanely smelly on my feet, with socks on no less. I am throwing them out & will put a replacement pair in.

I have a slender body, but I wear a 34 DDD bra. My mom is a seamstress so moving the buttons over will be nothing. I don't even use the belt. The hood won't work at all. I wear my natural hair and even with my hair twisted down, it doesn't fit. It is thinly lined, but it does keep you warm if you wear layers. The sleeves hit me at the wrist, but I like my sleeves long on anything so this might not be a problem for someone else. It's a nice jacket, just fits smaller than what I wanted.

The knit is guaze-ier so it will (& does) snag if you are not cautious, have worn it 8 or so times and it has a few pills so far.

3,Very cute and the child loves it! I thought it was very expensive for a child's t-shirt and it looked like flimsy material.,Thomas the Train T-shirt
3,"I really like the shirt but the material does not stretch as I am used to with products of this nature, forcing me to cut at the neck line for comfort rather than mold by stretching.",Material is not flexible.
3,"The pin is awesome but the pin is too long for the end piece. (I've posted pictures on what I mean) Also you need really thick fabric to keep the pin in place or else it's going to lean over to one side. If you're just planning to put these on your shoe laces you'll be fine.

IF you're worried about your pins breaking or pieces being lost, don't worry they put EACH PIN in a bag, in a bag, in another bag and in the shipping package with bubble wrap.",Pin won't stay in place and is too long for the end piece

3,"Nice looking, but VERY VERY hard to put on.",Three Stars
3,"Short shorts.  I think it might be a bit unfair to only rate these as a three stars, because the shorts themselves are nicely made and the materials is nice but they are WAY shorter than the picture.  Perhaps the issue is more so based on the fact that I don't' think anyone wants to see that much of my leg in a pair of shorts?  Sometimes if a pair of shorts is just a bit too short, I can take out of the hem and lengthen them.  Can't do that with these - wouldn't matter.  These appear shorter on the model than I would normally wear so I went up a size to wear them lower on my hips.  I would have had to go up yet one more size to get them to that point and they would still be too short.  It's too bad because the style is very nice and the color is true to what you see on the monitor.  If you look like the person in the photo or prefer shorter shorts, I think you might like these shorts but I think I'm past the point where short shorts are my friend.",Shorts were much shorter in person on a non-model

No matter how tight I fastened the straps, they gapped all around my feet,  ankles and calves. I gave them to my sister because they looked better on her.

3,These boots arrived quickly and fit as expected on my 7 yr old daughter but they wore out in a month on the toes and heels to where they do not look good at all.  I hadn't even paid the bill for them yet.  They seemed made ok for the price but it was more the material.  My daughter loves boots so she wore them almost every single day and they looked good with a wide variety of clothing.  My advice would be to buy them only for occasions where you child was not going to play hard and run around on the playground in them.  My girl is very hard on shoes because she is so active so I would not rate the company low for that but I do wish they had been more durable and remained nice looking for more than a month. They did seem to hurt her feet if she wore them all day too but maybe most boots would?  I would buy them again but not for every day use since they are so fragile.,Cute boots but not very durable

3,"I have always loved botanical prints, so I fell in love with this robe just on the pattern alone. Unfortunately, the print is more muted than the picture indicates. The reds are darkish, and the blues are not very vibrant. The background looks more like ecru than white, and there appears to be sparkles (glitter? Not sure) glued to the fabric. I was disappointed at first, but ultimately decided it was attractive even if not as pretty as the photo. The fit is okay, but very short - don't expect it to be as long below the belt as indicated in the picture. I happen to like short robes since I live in southern Florida, and don't need a long one to keep me warm so it worked well for me. If you want your legs covered, however, this may not be the robe for you. Also, out of the package, it's a little scratchy, but I am hoping a wash will soften it a bit. The price was very low for a lightweight, pretty robe, so I'm going to keep it. If I had paid anymore than $25, I would probably send it back. I wish I could give it a better review....at least the shipping was fast. :)","Just okay - short, a little scratchy, colors more muted than picture"

 2)This watch is also useless at night because there are no glowing phosphors on the hands.

It doesn't have the pointy parts that some dog pendants have though and it looks a good bit like a lab puppy so it was fitting and funny to get for my wife when we got our new puppy.

There isn't a high quality charm I've found that looks like a Labrador so this will have to do.",You get what you pay for.
3,Cute love it. But smaller than I thought,Three Stars
3,"I was really excited to receive this hat since I love vintage styles and was disappointed when it arrived in a padded envelope without any protection and was crushed.  I tried to puff the top back out, but it still has a big, very noticeable crease in it.  I tried it on and it fits well and still looked pretty good, despite the crease.  After I took it off, I set it down on a shelf.  I picked it up later that evening and the button fell off.  I was able to use a hot glue gun to glue it back on, but I was really disappointed that I had to do so.  Other than the crease, it is a really gorgeous hat and a very bright red.  The feather is very elegant, as is the button.  I think that they add the perfect touch!  I think I will still wear it every now and then, but I really wish that I could get rid of the big crease in the hat.
I received this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All thoughts and opinions are mine and mine only.","Really nice hat, but arrived damaged"

I ordered these in a 6 for the season ahead, but they were the same size, if not smaller, as his current shoes.  That being said, they were cute, sturdy, and light weight.  If your child does not have a very wide feet, then these would fit the bill.",Cute but too snug.
3,Like it a lot but maybe i shrunk a little its a very lose fit,Nice material
3,These are super cute. I get compliments all the time. My complaint is the plastic sole on the inside came unglued after using them once. It sticks to my foot and I have to adjust it with my hand. They seem to run a smidge looser than other shoes but works well for my slightly wide food.,Cute shoe
3,The construction seems lacking. The construction is single seem stitched throughout. and the bottom is not reinforced. Because of this I can't put anything heavy in it. Even a stainless steel water bottle with water feels like more weigh than the pack can bare. This product is not to the level of quality that I usually expect from Poler Stuff.,Even a stainless steel water bottle with water feels like more weigh than the pack can bare
3,This is super cute but it runs pretty small! My daughter is in 6-9 month clothes now and I decided to order this in a 12 month because it seems a lot of things I buy online usually run a little small. Thank goodness I did because this outfit fits her just enough that she can wear it for st. Patrick's day. It fits ok once it's on but it's not easy getting it on her. I honestly probably should have ordered an 18 month size but oh well. Also the shirt is covered in glitter shamrocks which is cute but it doesn't stay on the clothes there is glitter everywhere including my daughters hands and face! I washed it and air dried it so it wouldn't shrink and that helped a lot with the glitter. However not completely. So overall it was cute but runs pretty small and it will need to be washed at least once. Before I line dried it I stretched it out a bit so it would dry a little bigger. So hopefully it works out for me to at least get a couple cute pictures!,Runs small!
3,"I bought this shoe to replace a pair of original Response Boost Techfit shoes, but they are not quite the same.  These make my feet look more bulky but they do have a more true-to-size fit.

3,"The watch is very nice indeed, but there's an issue I find with many similar watches, which is the strap keeps coming out because there's nothing to stop it. Some cheap Timex have this clever stop and you never struggle with it.

UPDATE: I did change the strap and the struggle is over. I took it from the another watch, so I may change it later. A NATO style band is a possibility because it's safer if one of the pins fails. I do like this way, perhaps more military than blue. Notice it's also silicon.",Strap issue
3,It's expensive. It looks small got bigger size and still looks small. He might be able to wear it a little while. I wish I would of just bought a cheap sweatshirt and had a mall iron on a police saying instead of paying almost $40. I could of gotten Under Armor for that price.,For my son

Unfortunately they do not have any larger sizes or I would try again because I like the zip up idea.",Nice Shirt but Undersized.
3,"I really wanted to like these shoes, since they are attractive, waterproof, and have a substantial sole for walking and light hiking.  Plus, the price was very reasonable.  I bought them for travel, hoping to only carry one pair of shoes overseas, but I had to return them.  My feet are somewhat wide, and the outside of my foot will rub on certain designs of shoes.  These Merrells have a seam or ridge right where the outside of my foot--which gets tender--contacts the shoe, so I couldn't wear them.  Maybe more a fault of my feet than the shoe, as I've had good luck with other Merrells.  Hopefully your experience will be better than mine.","Nice shoes, but didn't work for me"

3,"First, the good: This is a pretty bracelet with enough visual bling to keep it from being dull. It matches well with other yellow gold pieces in my collection, although the gold is more ""yellow"" and flashy than the warm glow I'm used to seeing with yellow gold pieces. The two-tone design makes it especially versatile, and the silver bits have a good amount of sparkle. And like other Amazon Collection jewelry, the packaging is very giftable. The size is just right for my wrist, which usually takes 7"" bracelets.

All that said, the bracelet is very lightweight - more like an inexpensive trinket I'd pick up on a whim than the current price tag suggests ($50 as of this writing). I have doubts about durability, and the clasp doesn't seem intended for frequent use, since it's kind of flimsy. Given this is too small to fit over my hand without unclasping it, I suspect it might not last long enough to become a long-term part of my wardrobe. All in all, this is a pretty piece of costume jewelry, but I'm not sure I'd gift it or even purchase it at the current price.","Pretty, but lightweight and expensive for what it is"

3,"This small bag won't hold too much, but looks fairly nice. The Harris Tweed wool is nice and looks great, but while the material is certified, this bag isn't made by Harris Tweed - it is made by a separate third party. And that's fine, since Harris Tweed is just referencing the material (just the little top patch).

The clasp works well and so do the magnetic buttons... As long as they stay on - check the pictures. They are sloppily glued on, but seem to be holding firm for the time being.

There is one large interior pocket (the size of the bag) and one small zippered pocket along the back of the interior.

There is a rigid insert that just kind of flops around unsecured. There is no way to attach it to the bottom of the bag to provide rigidity. And finally, there is no hand grip/strap - only a shoulder strap, which makes setting it down and moving it around sort of strange.

I'd check elsewhere unless you really like the design, but it's an OK bag if it's on sale.",Small shoulder strap only bag with a nice woolen design

3,"I followed the size chart religiously, despite my own surprise at buying a large when I normally order a small. As I feared, the large is a true large. If you want the fit to be anywhere near skin tight like the picture, then follow the Amazon size chart instead. Otherwise, for the cost it seems reasonably well made. It smells like it's made out of rain jacket material, but I think the smell will fade if aired out. I'll update after an evening of Halloween shenanigans, but this seems like it should last through plenty of costume wearing festivities and more. Another thing I'll have to update once I get the proper size, is the bottom of the dress seems more A-line than pencil cut, which for me ruins part of the look.

An additional note, there is a 'modesty panel' sewn into the back of the dress to cover your bum. I think I'm just going to wear nude boyshorts to maintain the illusion, but I know that information might be helpful to some.",Don't follow the size chart

3,"Update Nov 23rd 2016

It's been few months now and wanted to update my review for those of you who are considering these shoes.

The fit has not changed. The tongue slides to the right and I'm have to pull it back to the center every time I notice it which is quite often.
They are definitely not for every runner. No arch support what so ever. Cushioning is very minimal almost none. So this may be ideal for bare foot type of runners. I use it for walking and running errands and they feel great. I've sweaty feet and they are not good wicking out sweat. So if you are one of those guys with sweaty feet then these shoes are not for you.

I was really looking forward for these shoes and my expectations were pretty high due to the cost of the shoe. I spend $120.

Pros:
Fits perfectly.
extremely light weight
comfortable

Cons;
Made in China. I was somewhat disappointed but I guess everything these days is made in china excluding high end electronics.
The tongue of the shoe slides. There is a little hook in the tongue thats supposed to prevent it..doesn't work that well
The quality is lacking for a $120 shoe.
My right heel slides to the left.
The color combination doesn't look good as pictured here on Amazon.
The material on the back of the heel is plasticky and not mesh. It's also kinda shiny.

I figured all of this after using the shoe for 2 days and not sure if I can return it now.
The shoe is probably worth around half of what it's listed for in my opinion.",Made in China - Not worth the listed price

3,"Needed replacement for my previous flip-flops. Went with Nautica due to the name brand, thinking can't go wrong. They are ok. I mainly use them around the house, not outside or anywhere else. Got them on sale so can't complain about the price.

Pros: Light weight. Fit as expected by size. Once used a few hours will 'stretch' to your feet.

Cons: Kinda cheapish. The ones I replaced were less than these, and felt better. Like, better materials used. I seen flip-flops like these Nautica for like $7 at a side walk vendor.

Over all: I'm still happy with purchase, since they are used only around the house. But I know I would not use them outside due to the material used. Would consider purchasing again if on sale.","Good feel, cheapish material. Over all Ok."

Pros-
Sizing good, looks good from a distance, looks quality.

Cons-
It's nowhere near as dark and shiny in person as it looks in the photo
It had thread falling out everywhere when opened up the package, plus a few loose ends of stitching were visible on the product it's self  Zipper quality isn't good, difficult to zip up.

3,"The costume itself is great, but just a word of advice, the front bow isn't attached! You basically wear it around your chest with a plastic band, and then wear the costume over the band. Not very comfortable. But my biggest complaint is that when it was shipped, it was shipped in literally the SMALLEST PACKAGING POSSIBLE, so the bows (which have almost like cardboard inserts inside to hold shape) are twisted and bent, and the head piece is completely unwearable. It was SO bent it has permanent damage. Not happy about that, I figured buying a more expensive version of this costume would pay off, but I just feel kind of ripped off. I love the costume. But having to buy another head piece after shelling out almost $100 is a real letdown.","The costume itself is great, but just a word of advice"
3,I was surprised when I opened the box and found that these shoes had obviously been worn - the bottom sole was scuffed and marked.  As long as I have been ordering from Amazon this has never happened when ordering new products.

3,"These bags are very well made and durable. Ive owned two, each lasting years of daily use. But, I have one big complaint. The main compartment has a one-pull zipper that goes all the way around versus two pulls, one on each side, that meet in the middle.

I ordered the correct size for my gift (large), but it was more like the next size down (medium).  If you are ordering one of these ""Attack on Titan Shinkeki No Kyojin"" hooded sweatshirts, keep that in mind.  The shipping was as bit slow as well, since it was shipped by a far-off asian land's postal service.

3,"I bought this for my elderly mother.  With a shirt it's not indecent.  I like to have her get little surprises in the mail.  This garment is well constructed and made from nice cloth.  BUT,  the sizing is more in line with what a 12 year old could fit into.  I bought a large too, which is usually too big for her.  Really ticked off with myself for getting Mama something she likes but can't enjoy. >.<",Nice but size is way off

It all comes down to the metal and how it looks, for example, I wouldn't be able to wear them with my Alex and Ani that I have a few I couldn't because it looks tarnish, no silver shine at all, just a piece of wire color, I did ask the seller and they said it's the material , it looks cheap for the price, it supports a cause close to my heart and that  is why I haven't return it yet, I wear it by itself, but I'm not happy, so it's a matter of opinions.",Sadly disappointed !

It feels like the finish will hold up well without a lot of noticeable wear to the rose gold finish. The size of the pendant is perfect. It is noticeable and still small. The chain is nice. It is delicate but feels sturdy.

So mostly this is a really nice piece. Except in the center of the pendant is not very consistent with the rest of the piece. It has a weird faux-gem finish that is meant to look like there are stones but really just looks lumpy and cheap. It is nowhere near as nice as the rest of the piece.",A missed opportunity.

3,"It's OK. The main pet-peeve I have with this rain jacket is that it's collar doesn't have a button to secure it. I bought this jacket so that I can run in a rain. It works.... but if there's no rain and I take off the hood, the collar has no way to be attached to anything, so it starts flapping on the wind, while at the same time poking me in the neck. This doesn't sound like much, until this repeats for the duration of your run. Which is VERY ANNOYING! Just a single button on the side wouldn't prevented this problem.

The internal zip pockets (the safety ones) can easily handle some cash, or the odd credit card.

BUT, I agree with all the reviews that say concealing a cell phone in one of the zipped pockets is impossible.  I have an iPhone 8, and while it fits in the safety, internal, zip pocket, and I do not think the weight threatens the material, it absolutely DOES drag down and makes it clear you are carrying something in there. I can't think of a single smartphone that would be fit discreetly. Likewise, I am leery of putting my keys in one of the zip pockets, worrying that the jagged edge would catch eventually on the fabric.

Final analysis: I do like this cardigan, but it's multiple pocket function--which is what attracts buyers and is presumably the justification for the extremely high price--just doesn't work. This should retail for no more than $40.  Maybe for the redesign, put a hidden pocket in the ""drapey"" parts on the front, which could conceal bulk better?","Quite nice, but not as advertised"

The medium (size 8-10) was too small.  She loved it though so I am ordering the large.  I will comment then to fill you in.  The fabric is a good quality, it is thick.

3,"The dress arrived quickly and well packaged. The outer layer of fabric feels like a stiff thin cotton and the inner layer is polyester. Since the outer layer is a cotton-like material, the dress does arrive wrinkled but that can be easily fixed with an iron. I read the measurements carefully before I ordered and ended up ordering a size Large. I'm 5'4"" and 135lbs and normally wear a S/M or 2/4 in dresses. The length was slightly above my knees although it may be too short for someone who is tall. The dress is too tight across the chest and shoulders and made taking the dress on and off hard. The dress is going back due to how tight it is on top however if the XL was prime, I would definitely re-order in a larger size.",Not bad if you're short and skinny

If you have never worn the good ole ECCO shoe then this review probably does not make any sense and you are happy with the current ""new normal"".  ALSO BEWARE....if you purchase shoes from a 3rd party vendor like I did (Beauty and Fashion Express) be advised that returns will probably involve you paying the return shipping (which I was OK with) but then finding out after shipping back that buyer will be charged a 15% restocking fee, that is wrong.

The fact that you have a virtually unthreatened market except that British knock off in one unusable dark color is no reason to have a garment made this way.

Also the long strap can only be used if the bag stays open like a tote but it can close once the long strap is pack inside the bag. I don't mind too much about that as the bag is deep with a wide bottom and the top is narrow so my stuff still feels secure.

3,"I bought the Maternal America Front Tie Dress at a maternity store in town and loved the way it fit: fitted in the shoulders, the skirt hung beautifully and there was plenty of room to grow in the belly. I liked it so much, I went to Amazon looking for something similar and found this dress. I loved the magenta color and the cut appeared identical.

When the dress arrived, the top was coral, not the magenta pictured. The magenta is definitely a better color for my skin tone, but the coral is nice for the spring & summer months. The fabric for the skirt is a stiff polyester, not the softer rayon/spandex blend of the top. This gives it more body, so it doesn't cling to you or show panty line, but it is not as comfortable or lightweight.

Since I only paid $27.29 for this dress (the blue and orange front tie was $110 in store), and since maternity clothes are hard to find, I will probably keep it. But it looks like a $30 dress, not a $110 dress.",... Tie Dress at a maternity store in town and loved the way it fit

I ordered it in size 6 and it fit me perfectly in length and width. However, it is too small across the breast; so small that I simply cannot wear it, my breasts are squeezed in and seem to burst out. And if I order one size bigger, I'm afraid it would be too long (possibly too wide too). I'm really, really disappointed because I liked it so much.

It would be great if swimsuit manufacturers understood that women are not cookie-cutter creatures; adding a cup size as a variable, besides the size of the swimsuit, would make all the difference in the world.

I just never thought in my wildest dreams this shirt would be big enough to fit our whole family in. Hopefully, the company will allow me to return it since it was never worn.

The colors are very close to MARPAT (real MARPAT with the Marines logo) with one big exception.  The coyote, green, and black match closely, but the light mint normally in MARPAT is light tan on the hat.  Its not a big deal just looking at the hat, but next to Marine MARPAT or Propper Digital Woodland (which is almost exactly the same as MARPAT in every way except the Marine's logo) the tan really sticks out.  That and the fact that the digital camo looks kind of wonky next to real MARPAT would keep me from recommending this if you need a matching uniform for airsoft, paintball, or whatever.  If you just need it to look cool, it does.  If you need it to stay hidden when the zombies come, it will work just as good as MARPAT unless the bright tan spots give you away.

For $12 plus $5 shipping its OK.  If I need another digital woodland hat, I'd go with a different brand like Propper.","Colors: close, pattern: bad digital.  Hat construction just OK."

It may cater to women who have bigger chests and for someone who is like 110lbs and 5'5'', most of us don't naturally have big chests so, come on. Realistic expectations were that it would be too big but the shoulder strap falls down a lot and the dress rides up... yeah.

The one from Target was dark brown/gold, with the same croc pattern, but with the number day feature. After a while, the date feature died and stopped working--I was pretty disappointed. As another review mentioned, after several wears the color on the strap started to wear off. I would say it's not worth the $40 (the brown one was about $30).
Also, I've had the brown one for about 2.5 years and just bought the orange one about a month or so ago. The brown is def more durable.

If you have a small wrist, it doesn't size down very well, and the clasp is very thin and difficult to close.  Lots of semi-sharp edges on the band causing small cut like marks on my wrist.

I'm not sure if it was money well spent or not.","Kinda cheap, bad clasp, looks ok from a distance."

The medium was still tight. I should've gotten the large and I never a large. They weren't so tight that I couldn't wear them, they were just not very comfortable. I don't really wear them as lounge pants anymore, instead, I wear them as leggings in the winter. The fleece lining makes them super warm and cozy. Personally, I wouldn't wear them as pants without a long shirt because they're so tight they show every detail of your butt and can cause some serious camel toe!

I am returning the dress: I am 5'8"", 148 lbs - I ordered a size 8 and it was big in the waist and back area - basically the entire top of the dress was too large, and I wear a 34DD bra, so I have never ever said that about a dress before.

3,"Beyond trying them on, I have not really worn these pants yet. The color is, well, pretty horrible. My wife hates them as a result. The only reason I didn't send them back is that I paid only $15 for them, so I figure I can at least wear them while doing yard work. One thing that interested me when I came across them on Amazon was the built-in cinch you can use to shorten the leg length while bicycling. Having played with it a little when I tried them on, I am not certain how well they will work in that use-case. I very rarely ride at night, so the reflective aspect of that feature is unimportant to me - I just need them to stay up and out of the chain without flapping around. Bottom line is that I would have sent them back immediately if I had paid full price because of the color.",Nasty color!

3,"The shoes is the pictures I posted are sized as follows: rain boots (this product) - size 8, Toms - size 8, pink boots - size 8, sandals - size 8, moccasins - size 7/8, stride rite sneakers - size 7, and brown boots - size 7.

For $10 I didn't really expect too much. I ordered a size 8 for my daughter who is between a 7 and 8 in other brands. The boot runs small by about a size. My daughter was wearing thin socks when trying these on, and I would probably need to order 2 sizes up if I planned on her wearing thick socks with these boots. I thought I was ordering up a size by getting an 8, but I should have gone with a 9 instead.

These boots are VERY flexible which is good for small kids, but it's probably just because they're cheaply made. I personally like the flexibility even though it means that they will likely wear away more quickly. The whole boot is made of the same plastic-rubber material and it is sparkly throughout. The sparkles are inside of the plastic so that they won't rub off which is nice!

There is not really much of an inner sole to these boots either. It almost looks and feels like there was once a lining in them that was torn out, but it's actually the way that they are made. This means that there is no fabric to keep feet warm in these which is okay for warmer rains, but you might need thicker socks for cool spring rains. If you intend for your child to wear thick socks all of the time, you should probably order 2 sizes larger!

I will be returning the pair I got today and getting a size 9 instead of 8 since my daughter regularly wears thin socks.

Bottom line: they're decent for occasional rain in the Midwest, but kids in wetter climates should choose a better quality boot. Buy at least 1 size larger than normal for wear with thin socks, and 2 sizes up with thick socks.","Okay for the price, but runs small."

3,"Cute boots, but WAY too small. I purchased a 9 ... there is no way they are sized correctly. I wound up selling them to a friend with size 7.5-8 feet, and they just fit her. I wanted them for costuming purposes, so the price wasn't unreasonable. I will hesitate to buy another pair because I don't know if the next size up will fit right or not. Rather frustrating. Quality-wise, they will be fine for costuming and light wear: I wouldn't recommend them for everyday as I don't think the soles will accommodate that much use. The soles are very flat, no traction whatsoever, and would be slippery on wet surfaces.",Too small!

3,"I wanted to love these shoes. They're very cute, and I got tons of compliments when I first wore them.

But the metal buckle on the strap is placed DIRECTLY over my ankle bone, meaning they dig into the bone every time I walk. Which sucks, because that's what you do in shoes.

Ultimately I kept them, because the sole of the shoe feels comfortable, but I am going to have to take it to a cobbler to put a strip of leather underneath the metal buckle so it doesn't make me die a little inside every time I take a step.

3,"I LOVED this bracelet.. until the clasp actually broke off entirely somewhere.
I am therefore not wearing the bracelet anymore for fear of losing it, as the bracelet would only be closed via the magnetic closure.  This makes me sad, as I have no idea how to fix this.

However, there's minimal to no arch support, construction is cheap, materials are cheaper still. As many reviewers note, also there's a great variance in size consistency.

One pair that I kept is rough on the soles of my feet, another has such minimal support that I have designated it for getting around at home.

3,"I live at the beach so I usually buy Ocean Avenue tankini tops size L when they are very cheap because I use them a lot. I love this brand and they last a long time, they are very well made and they always come with great breast support. Nevertheless, this time I was somewhat disappointed. Maybe it is just me and didn't look very good at the picture, but the cleavage is way too big. It will not represent a mayor problem for me because I am not big breasted and can have it fixed. But if you are big breasted, I don't think this will work for you since everything will come out of it's place. It is a hassle for me to try to return this item since I am living on an island in the Gulf of Mexico, so I'll just keep it and have it fixed.",Cleavage alert!

3,I was so excited about wearing this top with a skirt to a baby shower. I spent a lot of time in front of a mirror trying to tie it in order to make it look right. I never could and ended up returning it. The color was pretty and true to the picture.,Just a Bit Odd
3,"I was hoping this dress was going to be a hit...but it wasn't for me.  I have an athletic build...and junk in my trunk.  If you are a 36 or larger through the hips, this dress will surely make you look larger.  The colors are vibrant, and the overall cut of the dress is nice.  But again, the dress has flare and will create thickness for those of you that can pull off this style.  The length is just as it is on the model, and if you are closer to the model size, you will likely love this dress.","Nice colors, but not for me."
3,I might like it better if it fit according to my usual size. I wear 34 g in fantasie & freya bra but the 36 g was still too small in the band. I couldn't even latch all the hooks on the back. The cup size was too big so maybe the cup size runs true to size. I might try a 38 f to see if that fits.,band size runs very small.
3,"Too wide, yet too short. The sweater's color bleeds into the white lettering.","Good use for one year or two, but..."

3,"This pendant is nice- it is bigger than I expected, and the bead necklace is quite long- the beads I got are much darker than in the photo on the site. Once I put it on, the pendant was down to under my ribcage. I bought one for my 8yr old son and he complained that the string was pulling on his skin on the back of the neck. I think I will undo the beads and use a string or 2 of elastic thread and make this into a shorter necklace and something I can wear more often.
The color of the beads runs! I sprayed some perfume on and the beads smeared the color all around my neck so be careful!",This pendant is nice- it is bigger than I expected ...

3,"Nice design, good customer service ... but the sizing was VERY inaccurate. The write-up said the shirts ran large, so I ordered a large (which is what I normally wear).

They said that the manufacturer was responsible for the inaccurate wording.",Timber Wolf Organic T-shirt 100% Organic Cotton Short Sleeve Shirt in Adult Sizes (Large Adult)
3,"The shoe itself is of very good quality, feel and look. Unfortunately the bed of the shoe is not comfortable to my foot. I experience pressure points on the side of my feet, it just doesn't seem to be shaped ergonomic. My foot is on the narrow side with a pronounced arch.
I don't necessarily fault the shoe nor the brand, as I have other rockport shoes that fit quite well and are very comfortable.

3,"This was a lively bracelet. It fit well. Unfortunately, the main charm, Gratitude, fell off after three wearings, and was lost. I think it was not securely fastened to the ring.

I would recommend it only with a different chain.","Chain came kinked, but pendant is lovely"

Second, the length of the buckle makes it almost impractical to use, since it will not fit between normal belt loops on jeans (well if you do not wear BIG BIG jeans that is).  It also lays strange, kinda facing the floor, so to really read it, you have to pull it up.  Defeats the purpose in my opinion.  I would go with a normal sized buckle!",Okay Buckle

3,"There is a design flaw.  They say it is one size fits all.  I think if you are a woman's 8 or 7 1/2 you will be fine.  I am a size 9 sometimes a 8 1/2 and I found them too be too short, but it is where the claws are. Wherever there is a toenail, the fabric indents making that section too short for me.

First the positives, it was a high rise, which was wonderful, elasticized waist, great, nicely warm and lined. Also, the material was good. The negatives were that it was too pricey, pulled at the knees but was very roomy and nice otherwise. But the greatest disappointment was that as you put your legs through to wear it, the line would get bunched up.

It's especially tight across the chest, and I'm flat chested enough to wear undershirts instead of bras most of the time.  It comes just below my knees, so if you are a couple of inches taller and VERY skinny (think Calista Flockheart) you could probably get away with it.

3,"As per the previous reviewer, the arms are very tight.  Despite it fitting fine waist/shoulder wise, it noticeably restricts your lateral range of motion with your arms.

It is certainly unique by US standards.  The collar flaps are unusually massive and look quite bizarre.  It also folds and crumples in strange ways, so it almost looks like your wearing a blanket.  The material itself feels very cheap, and it's really not suitable for winter.  I would say that it's best for 35-55 degree weather.  Any lower and you'll probably freeze to death.

Not all bad, shipped faster than expected, and it looks okay with the buttons unbuttoned.  Buttoned up it looks kind of ridiculous because it's folding all over the place.

I actually ordered a Large but ended up receiving an extra large outfit and a medium pair of shoes! Thought that was pretty funny. The extra large ended up being the same size as the larges I got elsewhere, so I guess I should be glad they sent the wrong one of those.

3,"Skirt looks very classy and has nice detailing, color, and material feel. Unfortunately, the hip sizing was not accurate at all on their size chart for the size I ordered that corresponded with my correct measurements using their chart. (I've bought from style J many times before.) The hip sizing was some inches off to the point that it didn't even fit my sister who is TWO skirt sizes smaller than I am. Yes, she wears a US size 2 skirt, and (I usually wear US size 6) but the ""US 10"" skirt I ordered from Style J was too tight on her also! It doesn't seem too many others have had issues with the sizing, so perhaps mine was sewn incorrectly. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to return it so I guess I'll have to try to sell it on ebay. I just wanted to warn others looking about the size difference so that they don't have the same plight!
Actual measurements for size 30 (US 10) as follows: Skirt Waist: 30 inches; Skirt Hip: 37 inches. Skirt Bottom: 25 inches Skirt Length: 28.5 inches.

3,"I really like the design of this suitcase. It is very classy. I have other Rockland 20"" carry on bags (the 20"" Gold Wave bag specifically) and I did not stop to check the dimensions of each. I falsely assumed that 20"" bags by the same manufacturer would be approximately the same size.

So for anyone who has purchased this brand before, please be aware of the dimensions. This bag is a lot smaller than other 20"" bags I have bought from this manufacturer in depth and width. Overall there are advantages.. I will never have to worry if an airline will allow this as a carry-on, but it seems to only fit about half of what I was able to fit in my previous 20"" bag by this manufacturer.","Beautiful case, but quite small"

I like how the material has a silky feel to it.  The only tag listed washing instructions and stated the material to be 88% polyester, 12% spandex.  There is NO cotton, even though the description states material is cotton + polyester.  The material has a nice shine to it.  The tank measures 23 top-to-bottom and 15.5 armpit-to-armpit.

There is some wasted space under the necklaces on the mirror part. I am thinking about adding an area here for my stud earrings or broaches. In addition, there is wasted space ontop of the necklaces in the inside. Having alot of jewelry I want to optimize the space as best as possible and although this is a good start it has some flaws. Could have a better area for watches and could be deeper. I would liked to have seen shallow velt tubs on the mirror door (inside). Also the hanging it on the wall was aweful. The holes on the back of the mirror were not even so I ended up drilling four holes in my wall...not happy! Also to still the srews in the holes was not the most pleasant experience....

- The pattern is not exactly as shown, but are probably cut from the same bolt of fabric. My leggings look similar to the ones shown, but are definitely not as cool. Also, they sent the wrong ones.

after wearing these a few rounds, they are still fairly comfortable but when i walked a lot(cart path only) there was a blister that developed on the heel of my left foot, due to the top of the shoe rubbing. not sure if the blister issue on one foot is due to the asymmetry of the uppers or the way i walk, but it made those rounds very uncomfortable. i ended up tying my left foot super tight to prevent any movement/rubbing.",a half size up feels perfect. the asymmetrical design is just a gimmick

They sent me a large (thankfully!) and it is almost too small in the shoulders and bust to wear (I'm an A cup so it's hard to be too small in the bust on me!), but leaves plenty of hip room. It is also quite long, so would work well with leggings. Just and FYI to order at least two sizes up for a comfortable, slightly loose fit.","Good quality, runs VERY small."
3,"I am a Gentle Souls connoisseur.  They typically run a little large or are true to size.  The problem with these boots is they were not available in a half size which is really what I needed.  I first purchased a larger size but they were huge.
What I like: water resistant if not water proof for brief submersion (deep puddles or flooded streets). Attractive (subjective opinion) rain boot that doesn't look like a rain boot. Easy - ish to pull on and take off.
What I don't like: They are slightly tight across the top of my foot - I have narrow heels and a slightly wider forefoot with a high arch - and this causes discomfort after a couple of hours. This effect is worsened if wearing thick socks.  One option is to remove the soft leather insole, but then they aren't as comfortable.",Effective as a water-resistant rain boot.

Not sure if it would be a mistake to get a size smaller, because then they may be too small.

3,"Pros and cons to these boots. First, the package is nothing more than a box. That is it -no trills, The boots come wrapped pretty well to prevent damage to the gold plated chain around the ankle. The boots are beautiful and are as the picture depicts. However (cons) the leather is not given thus the boots are less than flexible when you are walking.  The design of these boots pose some challenges as well. The arch inside the boot keeps the owner on the tips of toes. This will cause many issues if you intend to wear them for a great length of time. Secondly, there is not padding for cushion inside the boots. This lends to the arch awareness stated previously.

Other than items listed the boots are beautiful and the sole of the boots keep you stead even I wet weather. This was a pleasant surprise given the height of the heel.  You will feel stable.",The boots come wrapped pretty well to prevent damage to the gold plated chain ...

Sadly, when i got the cosplay it was a tad too big & spacey for a person my size. The shorts that came with this cosplay were too uncomfortable & big so I used my own black short-shorts. The cosplay was comfortable but I wore it in the hot weather (not a good decision) and I was sweating bullets. The boot covers were crap and I never used them.

3,"Disappointed .....  very average, meh !  For $145, I expected much more.

I ordered the cobalt blue Neely Flat, and I love (!) the color.  I also like the way the shoe is structured and holds my (wide-ish) foot securely (and without rubbing over the front joints of the foot).  I really appreciate the all-leather construction, including even a leather insole which tops the ""orthotic"" insert.  And there's nice room for my toes.  Wonderful !

But ....

There is almost zero arch support.  Nor is there much insole padding.  It feels as if the balls of my feet are walking with less padding than a piece of hard cardboard between my feet and the ground.  The heel has a bit more.

Sad, very sad.  I have multiple pairs of Danskos, but this one is plain disappointing.  I had hoped to have found a semi-dress, sturdy, arch-supportive yet soft flat which would take me many miles.  This is not it.

I probably could go out and buy other, better orthotics/arch-support/padding, but for $145 I don't feel I should have to do so.  I would also thereby lose the nice leather insole liner.  I haven't decided whether or not to return these, but I'm leaning that way.

Where do I find my perfect flat ?  Or even such a shoe with an inch or inch and a quarter heel ?  If anyone knows, please let me know !","Disappointed .....  very average, meh !"

3,"This dress is a ones size fits all. I am 5'9 and 140lbs, and I wear a 36C bra. The Length was good and the waste and rear fit well but the top half was a little loose. The purple color was not purple, more of a load weird pink color. So I think the black would have been a better choice. I decided to write this review to help others who are interested in buying. I think if you are short the dress will need to be altered. I think if you have a small chest this dress will not fit on top at all. The material is stretchy to a point. I would say at my height give or take a inch or two, and you weigh 130lb to 160lb and have a full chest this dress will fit you beautifully. For everyone else this will not fit. So not so much one size fits all. I sent mine back. I hope this helps. I will attach a photo, I think the dress was not flattering for me.",This review is a helpful size guide.

3,"I purchased this dress specifically for St. Patrick's Day. It is a bright emerald green color, and for that reason, I am keeping it and not returning.

It also didn't arrive with a belt as shown in the picture, so just FYI there. I added a belt to define my waist and try to draw attention from the material that was oddly bunching and making my hips look wider than they are.
The material snagged quite easily in the first wearing yesterday. I will only be wearing this dress once more on St. Patrick's Day, and then it's going in the trash.

3,"As I wear a size 5 UK, I ordered the 5/6. When I first got them, they fit beautifully. Nice and snug not not tight, and cosy. The ""memory foam"" soon created a perfect foot-shaped dent. Unfortunately, within a month, the ""memory foam"" began to flatten, within 2 months the foam was / is completely flattened. I now have cute slippers that are a size too large for me, and I cant wear them without socks. I never wear my slippers out --- find that annoying! -- but the sole has also worn down from daily wear inside on carpet and laminate flooring. The grippy bumps are gone, and there is a hole the size of a 10p coin under the right toe. I am sure it is only a matter of time before it wears through the foam. As for cleaning...they do attract dirt, but there is nothing that tells you how to clean them. I've been surface cleaning them for the past year...but I finally had to break down and put them in the washing machine....and pray the sole didn't break up. Will I buy another pair? Well, what attracted me to these in the first place was the Scottish design, with the Westie and the tartan trim. If I cant find similar elsewhere, and I do decide to repurchase these, I'd buy a smaller size, and keep in mind, they only last a year with indoor use only.",Buy Smaller - the foam compresses flat
3,"they work for around town and shorter trips, took them on a 2 and a half hour one way trip and i didn't notice any discomfort but don't know how they would do on a really long trip, I wear them every time I ride and do a fair amount of walking in them and they are only slightly uncomfortable after walking in them for about a half hour or so. Haven't taken them on really hot rides but they breathe just fine. They are true to size but aren't for those with wide feet, good feel when riding, will protect from moderate injuries,

I don't find them the most stylish mostly because of the sides of the tongue stick out, but if you wear pants that fit over them they look just fine. I've had them for about 3 months and they show a little wear but I have them on about every other day. if you like to tuck your pants into your boots the outer layer folds down and you can tuck your pants into them without having to deal with them bunching up around your leg.

my biggest complaint is that the zippers are cheap and are difficult to zip up, you have to be careful not to pull too hard, on mine i can already see one of them wearing and fraying and I can tell it will eventually become useless.
  For the price they aren't bad but I hate bad zippers and that is a huge factor for me, I will soon be getting a higher end set of riding boots because of this. I would not suggest these if you are looking for something that you will be using for a long time but are a decent choice if you're on a budget.",Not too bad for the price

3,"I tend to wear a medium in shirts.  My bust size is 32... and I wear a 4 or 6 in dresses.  This corset which I bought in a medium was extremely tight and had a noticeable gap in the back after it was tightened.  It also doesn't have a modesty piece were the ties are, which creates an unflattering and incomplete look.  Although I should have expected that with a ZIPPER based corset.  :(  Honestly, I have purchased other corsets from Amazon in the past for a similar price point which are better constructed and are far more elegant.  If you are purchasing this specific one, buy at least 2 sizes up.  I'm not a large person in any form or shape and this was ridiculously small.

The good:  The colors are true to what is shown on the website, the zipper is sewn in well, the overall construction is properly aligned.  No running threads, no tears.  The bow was hot glued on which was tacky but not noticeable.  The ribbons weren't frayed.

Shop around, this isn't a horrible corset but you can find better for the same price point.","Shop around, this isn't a horrible corset but you can find better for the same price point."

They are flat and the toe area is a little wider than I would like for my own fit. You can't really tell from the picture but the shoe part is a rubbery material and they stick out on the sides when your foot bends. The color is accurate to the picture, I liked the color at first but I have grown tired of the turquoise and bright yellow-green shoelaces as they don't match most of my workout clothes, which is something I should have considered prior to buying.

3,"Sperry Top-Sider Women's Seacoast Nubuck Fashion...
These are a good errand shoe.  They fit a little loose in the heel and just a bit narrow across the ball of the foot, but workable for me.  They do not provide arch support and there is not enough room to add an insert if you wear one.  Since it has elastic across the vamp, it helps balance any inconsistencies with the fit for me.  I like that they are a slip on that looks like a tie and they go well with jeans.",Nice looking shoe
3,Good Product but not as I had expected. It tends to cling rather than remain flowy,Three Stars
3,"I've had this hat for like two years and can't believe I have never reviewed it - I wear it every single day in the winter and it still seems brand new. Warm and cute at the same time. I'm really picky with my hats, I don't want the slouchy hipster beanie and I don't want some frilly pom pom on the top. This is simple yet fashionable at the same time, nice adult hat. I live in the North East and it gets me through the winters.

----Updated: Knocking down to 3 stars. I bought this hat about 2 years ago and it is my favorite hat ever, I absolutely loved it. However, I unfortunately left it on the subway the other week, so I immediately went sorting through my past Amazon purchases to re-order one. I'm not sure if it's because there are like 500 different merchants selling this hat, but the quality is super inconsistent. I absolutely loved my old hat from day 1, but this hat is definitely made from a different material that doesn't feel as nice, and it's definitely not as thick (last time I got a black one and a tan one so I actually side by side compared it with the tan one that I still own). It's also not knitted together in the same way- the lines are thicker which makes my head look stupid. Pretty disappointed and left wondering which merchant I have to order from to get the original style, or if they're all poorer quality now....",Inconsistent Quality

3,"My 11 yr old absolutely LOVES this! I was surprised at how quickly she was able to use the monofin correctly...it was within minutes. She received this for Christmas, and uses it 2-3 times each week. She wore the tail with the monofin a lot at first, but mostly just wears the monofin now. The only disappointing factor is that the stretchy cuffs that hold the monofin on are wearing out. Yes, she uses it a lot, but this happened more quickly than I expected. She complains that it is difficult to stay on her feet now, and is interested in trying a different brand next time.","Daughter loves it, but cuffs wear out quickly"

3,"Overall nice shorts. My 10 year old son loves under armor so we had to order these for him. He chose the yellow color. The shorts do run bit big but that is typical for my son as he is very skinny and we run in to the issue of his pants/shorts being to big all the time. These particular shorts are see thru in the yellow area. My son was unaware of this and wore them to camp a few weeks back. While running around playing soccer at camp with his friends, one of the kids stopped him and told him that his green briefs were showing. My son looked down and said it looked like he left the house that day in just his green underwear.
He decided to keep the shorts just knows he has to be careful with underwear choice",big and see thru
3,I had my choice narrowed down between this and the Arche as they have a similar look and both are supposed to be really comfortable. I went with the Arche despite being more expensive as these hit a little higher on my ankle and made my legs look a little chunkier.,"Cute shoe and comfortable, but made another choice."
3,I wear a size 7  and my feet are pretty narrow. But I think I should have gone half size up because the shoe felt like it was squeezing my toes. Despite keeping the laces lose enough my toes do not feel comfortable. Overall I like it but I would order half size up,Order half size up ... Narrow.

3,"The sizing is incorrect. This fits more like a medium or a large in women's sizing. The fleece lining doesn't continue to the sleeves. It has drop ""dolman"" sleeves.

It arrived with loose threads, and it's well made, but will likely fall apart pretty quickly since the knit isn't properly sealed. It arrived smelling like plastic or gasoline so I ran it through the wash twice and the fleece lining ripped and left fluff all over the outside of the cardigan. Definitely not something that will survive subsequent washes well.

However, it's warm and fairly priced for what it is. I'm going to use it to stay warm in my chilly office and I've no doubts it will be great for that.",Know what you're getting into before you buy!

One big flap would make more sense.  And I carry a large billfold that will accommodate a checkbook, so it is a little too big for this tiny purse.  If you want a small purse, this one is for you.

3,"This jacket is beautiful... BUT it runs a bit small particularly in the chest area, so if you tend to be a bit busty, get a size larger than you think you need. Additionally, there are these big ugly silver snap closure that show when you are not buttoned up.

3,"I wanted to like this more than I do.  I am a very modest person, but I am always hot.  This ""tank"" is much more like a sleeveless t-shirt.  I prefer a high neckline that doesn't show everything when I bend over, but the neckline on this is so high, that it is hot for summertime wear.  On the other hand, the arm holes are huge, which allows a little more air circulation, but it also shows everything.  I also wish that this top had less polyester, and more cotton, which is more breathable.  In the red, the fabric is 60/40.  That wasn't listed anywhere when I ordered it.  For a lot of people, this top would be fine, and it will be fine for me to layer under another shirt once the weather cools down, but it doesn't do what I wanted to do, which is provide clothing which is modest, yet cool.",Not what I was hoping for
3,"Giving 3 stars.
5 stars for beauty but it really is super bulky and not practical for putting in purses. Something to use as glasses storage in your car maybe.
1 star for fit. I have cat eye glasses. The shape of the case is not square enough to fit my glasses. The widest point of the frames is at the cateye points and the case is not wide enough (see photo). Also, the case is just too oddly shaped to fit the folded arms of the glasses (see photo).

I even went by interior measurements given in product questions, and I measured my glasses, however, dimensions given were not correct.

3,"This outfit gets 3 out of 5 stars for me. Why? Because I'm giving them the benifit of the doubt. I'm kind of a big girl so I already knew that if I ordered an XL from China, it'd be like a M for me. My chest is a bit larger than some but I am I little shorter than some as well, so a handful of clothes can fit me because of that. If only for this issue, the seller would get 4 stars.

But also, this was not a short sleeved dress. This dress was sleeveless. Like a tank top. It's still cute but like I said, I'm a little thick so if I wanted to wear this out, I'd have to wear it as a shirt or wear shorts under it to a party.

3,"My overall appraisal of this jacket is that it's a stylish and warm winter jacket. I like the durable outer layer and it has proven to be sufficiently weather resistant. That being said....
The downside, and reason I'm giving it 3 stars, is as follows:
1. The fit is too slim/the waist to shoulder ratio is too far apart for me. The upper torso of the Large jacket fit me best, but the waist is too slim; however, with the XL, the waist was perfect but the upper torso was huge. I felt like a football player on the sidelines when they wear the trenchcoat over their pads. So, for me (6'1"", 230lbs, 36 waist), I was disappointed that I couldn't find the right size.
2. Too few pockets/storage options. There are two outer pockets and one small inner chest pocket. I personally like to keep my sensitive items inside the jacket (i.e. cellphone, wallet, etc..) so that I can warm my hands in the outer pocket. With this jacket that is not an option. And, yes, you can always just put your hands in the same pocket as your phone/wallet, but when it's wet snowing/raining out, the water slides down your sleeves and into those pockets so that's no longer an option.
Hope this helps.",I like the durable outer layer and it has proven to ...

Pros:
Well stitched, doesn't look like it will tear easily, no frayed ends, etc.

Cons:

3,"The watch is perhaps a good quality watch but I am returning it because the face is way way too small, it looks crowded compared to the picture, and the frame is not the metallic color you se won't he screen but almost deep red gold color. The picture suggesting how the watch would look like on an arm shows the face as much larger compared to the arm. In the picture the arm looks pretty large, men's arm, but in fact, it has to be a rather tiny arm as I am a very average person with rather thin bones, and yet this watch looks so small almost like a ladies watch. It gives it a light, discrete quality which I do not envision in a men's watch, as far as I am concerned. The leather band is much too thin, thinner than any of the three other leather watches I own. It is also a bit narrow, again suggestive of an elegant ladies watch.

Why the 3 stars: perhaps the watch is actually a good quality watch, this review is not questioning this at all. But the pictures and colors misrepresented it. Lesson learned: never buy a watch without first trying it on and seeing the color, the feel, the size as it is on your arm, and the weight.","Pictures misrepresent color, the size, and the look: never buy a watch without trying it on"

Overall, if all you need is to bring a credit card, an ID and like a $20 out somewhere, this is a great size for that. But if you want something more functional, I would look elsewhere. I have other slim wallets that hold a lot more than this one. I got this as a Gold Box deal, so I won't return it, but I doubt I will be able to use this for too long.",This wallet is very pretty.

3,"These are ok. Very soft and comfortable with no pinching, blistering, painful pressure points etc. Best thing about them is their price and the fact that they support a worthy cause. The cons are that they are pretty shapeless - just long ovals, like two small ciabattas, extremely flat at the footbed and offer absolutely no arch support. I'm a true US 8 in length, and between narrow and medium width. I bought the size 8 and my feet are pretty much swimming in them, though to their credit, they somehow manage to stay on when I walk.

This watch needs to have the description changed on it on Amazon. No where on the box or watch itself does it say that it is a woman's watch. BUYER BEWARE!!!
The only thing that could possibly make this a woman's watch is that the band doesn't seem to be as big as the men's watches.

3,"So, the belts are great while they last, but the weak point is these buckles.  They use some kind of a pressure-fit nail/rivet to keep the two halves together, and those work out over time.  When they fall out, your pants fall down.

If I could find the part to repair them (which probably costs all of $.02) that would be fine, but having your belt fail during the middle of a work day and having to hold it together with zip-ties is kind of embarrassing.  So, unless you want to carry a backup belt, I'd carry a backup buckle.

Also, if anyone knows where to get these little pins they use to hold the two halves together, I'm all ears.  I have two now that I need to fix.",Apparently the only (very expensive) way to repair the belts when they break.

I do have to say that the wheels held up well over the cobblestone walkway, and the wooden plank walkway that I walked through in the resort we were in.

3,"I love moons and moon jewelry. I bought this in hopes that it wouldn't look too ""fancy"" since I work at a hardware store. Most of the time I am in a t-shirt and jeans/yoga pants.

I received this product today and upon taking it out of the package, I did like that the seller offers a small pouch that the jewelry comes in. It is a nice touch when purchasing a jewelry item.
However, upon taking it out of the sealed package, I noticed the metal moon already had scratches on the surface. It is pretty noticeable when you take a good look at the moon.

The necklace itself was also rather long. There are links big enough to get the lobster claw in to adjust it smaller, but it still hangs right around my cleavage area when adjusted. I figured it wouldn't be an issue and I could use a chain from another necklace to make it smaller. However, when I went to change it, I noticed they fitted the charm to not be taken off. You would have to disturb the small metal links, which could in turn damage the whole item.

I wish there had been more pictures of the product, so I could see the chain and the length on a model. I also wish mine wasn't already scratched up before I even wore it. Had I seen this in person, even at the minimal price, I probably wouldn't have bought it.

Update: Bico is a wonderful company to deal with. They sent a replacement for the bracelet right away.

I can't say much for durability because they were too uncomfortable to wear and therefore had to be returned.

These shoes did do their job, the protected my feet, and were rather comfortable, other than the fact that the soles came out within the first hour, but again its still better than cuts and scrapes from the pool.

I work as a housekeeper in a meat department which requires hosing everything down. Needless, to say, my shoes got worn out pretty quickly and no longer keep my feet dry. Solution: Waterproof socks!

These socks kept my feet 100% dry for the first couple of weeks. Soon after, they only kept my feet mostly dry. A week ago they developed tiny holes near my big toes in the lining. So now my feet are becoming wetter. Thankfully my feet stay warm and are dryer than if I wore regular socks.

Edit: Well, after wearing this in the morning, changed shoes after less than an hour, I did have blisters on both heel, worst on my left, so better make sure to buy a bigger size that will give your feet an extra allowance, if it's very fit, it will kill you, again, less than an hour and my work place is just a 3 minute walk, the reason i was able to change shoes immediately, now i have to decide whether to give it another try after my blisters are healed or just give it away. too bad, i really love the design.","my heel hurts, gave me blisters"

I can't pull off bra straps showing.  I am 5'6"" and it actually hit me about 3 inches above the knee, so considerably shorter than it looks on the model.

That being said the color is nice and happy and the over all fit was fine, but due to the bra strap situation I fear this will have to go back.

edit* after trying the dress on for a 2nd time with a better mirror I see the fit really isn't flattering and after wearing for a few minutes the material is scratchy.  It's going back for sure.",Probably going back...

3,Cute but they're a bit snug. Won't last very long on a growing boy.,Three Stars
3,"Gorgeous sleek minimalist design, very comfortable fit. Unfortunately, I found the balance too precarious. The sole of the shoe is narrow enough that if you're on an uneven surface or your weight shifts to the outside of your foot, the shoe tips outward very easily. Given the height of the wedge, this is difficult for your ankle to control quickly. I've sprained my ankle in shoes similar to this many years ago and don't want to risk it again.",very comfortable fit. Unfortunately

3,"I am 6 feet tall and 160 pounds. After reading the reviews of this top, I went to size up in hopes that it would fit me like it does on the model. I really love the material of this top. It's kind of like a sweatshirt on the inside with a sweater on the outside. It's really cute except I got an extra large and it is way too big. The sleeves  fit perfectly and the length is good but it is a bit too large for my body. I am going to order the large and see how that fits. Despite the fact that it is pretty big on me, I got a lot of compliments today so I'm keeping the extra large.","Cozy, but read the review"

3,"*** STINKS something fierce!!! ***

So, this is a stretch polo made with a fabric that has a nice feel.
HOWEVER: it smells absolutely terrible. This is not a short-term or temporary glitch. I washed it three times and soaked it over several days and - it STILL STINKS.

Description of the smell: it smells like a toxic mix of industrial chemicals. Not like a ""natural"" bad odor, but rather a man made, toxic smell. The fumes are persistent and potent. I have now soaked it in Arm & Hammer  detergent for a week straight and the smell seems to have dissipated slightly.

It is a nice polo, structurally. But, honestly, should you have to treat it at home with a combination of Arm & Hammer, Dishwashing Liquid, Pinesol, and other heavy duty detergents before you can wear it?

3,"How do you review socks?  The cover my feet and absorb some sweat.  I do have 2 points that immediately come to mind.  1 - The quality of the sock feels pretty good.  They are a bit thin (which makes them fit into dress shoes nicely) and they don't have a reinforced toe (so any nail beyond the end of your toe will tear a hole pretty easily) but they are comfortable.  2 - My only real complaint is that, the thread used to create the argyle pattern creates a spider web like maze within the sock that sometimes makes putting them on a complete pain.  Once they are on, no issues, but my toes catch the thread all the time.  For $20 socks, I wouldn't expect that to be the case.  I don't by argyle all that often so perhaps that is a standard issue with this type of sock, but I figured I'd note it.  End of the day, not a bad purchase (I got them on lightning deal) if not a bit expensive for socks.",Just OK.  There are probably better options at this price.
3,"This Michelle Trouser Jean is a different cut and style than the Michelle Trouser Jeans I bought last year. I just compared both pairs, and this year's version is cut tighter in the butt and thigh, slimmer in the lower leg, and slightly shorter than last year's version (same size).  Comparing the numbers on the tag sewn inside the front, this year's version has a different ""cut number"" and ""style number"" than last year's version.  Still the same beautiful fabric and high quality construction I expect from NYDJ, but it's disappointing that two pairs of pants with the same product name - and the same size - would fit so differently.",Different cut and style than the Michelle Trouser Jeans I bought last year

3,"The good:  The pants look just like the picture & the escaping turkey is super cute.  The material is rather soft & they are made in the USA (really, really love that).  Very comfortable!

The Bad:  I ordered a size small thinking these would be roomy for me (I wear a size 2 in womens pants).  I wanted them for Thanksgiving so I would have lots of room to eat way too much.  Uh...I got way more room than I could ever use...  My better 1/2 wears a mens medium & this size small was ok on the waistband but big on him everywhere else.  His regular size of medium would have fit us both at the same time.  Since they have the boy pee-pee hole I'm not overly surprised they didn't fit me.  But I was surprised that they were so big on my man.  Also, I'm not totally sure how many dudes would be interested in cute Thanksgiving pants.

If you like giant pants, you will like these.  If you have super thick legs, these will be great for you.  If you're petite, look somewhere else for cute pants.

If the seller would make their designs in womens pants I would be their #1 fan.",Cute lounge pants

3,"My daughter is tall for her age and has been wearing 18 month old clothing before she turned a year old.  The pants are much longer than pants from Gymboree or Carters for the same age range.  The socks are cute as is the onesie (which seems to fit the same as other brands).  The colors are not too bright and the price was quite affordable when I purchased this.  However, the orange pants had a rather large hole in the seam.  It's easy to fix, but I shouldn't have to fix brand new clothing.  This is the third time clothing I've ordered from Amazon has had a hole in it or some other defect.  Makes me wonder if this is not outlet shopping and that I should just start to expect lower quality.",Hole in the pants.

They do seem to run large. I wear a 7 1/2 and there is room to go down a 1/2 size.
*Update: I had to take a star away from my rating after wearing them. I have only wore them once. Looked cute on and definitely cheap looking once I took them off. Did not wear well. Material creased and cracked. Plus they squeak all the time. And the fit, can't quite decide. They do run big, but the overall comfort ?? Stiff to walk in and no cushion for your feet plus the fit of the boot is just weird feeling. I would recommend inserts.

Cons : Durability. Fit. Sizing. Noisey.",Cute!...until the constant squeak

When they were washed, they shrunk up to where they were supposed to be - around the hips.

The problem is, this comes at the cost of comfort.  They are pretty heavy and eventually start hurting the bridge of my nose.  They also make it difficult to see peripherally but this is a problem with any sunglasses with thick arms.  Overall, I think they're nice looking and well built sunglasses but if you're like me, I wouldn't recommend them for someone that plans on wearing them for extended periods of time.",Well built but heavy and uncomfortable.

My fault for choosing a night on the town to break them in, but they're booties...I have several other pair and none of them caused so much pain.
They say they're true to size, and they are. The size wasn't an issue. Itwas the width.

3,"I love these caftans, they are beautiful and fit great. I bought two of them (different colors).

The design and length are perfect, the pockets are functional in the surf and the fly and lace-up system is great, the material also seems strong. I gave the rating three stars because the stitching has continually unraveled on the hems since I bought them, after about 6 months with minimum harsh wear and washing the white stencil pattern has faded and the black embroided design has frayed and I am still cutting loose ends of thread from the sub-par sewing. I'll give these shorts 6 more months before I'll need to look for a fresh pair.",Well designed shorts let down by manufacturing and quality of stitching.

Perhaps i'd spend $10 more dollars and try to get a band that seems more durable and a finer qulaity when this one dies.

3,"When I opened the box for the first time, my reaction was, ""Wow. This is gaudy."" I wanted to give more of a balanced review, so I took it to work and shared it with some of my co-workers. Responses ranged from ""Did you get that in a Cracker Jacks box"" to ""How do you adjust it?"" Most people thought it should cost less than $5 and be available in the party supplies aisle at Target.

I do agree that it would be a fun ring for a girl...probably one who likes princesses. But would I want to spend more than $30 for a ring for a little girl? And, at the time of this writing, it's available only in a size 7, which clearly is an adult's size. The amount of ""bling"" makes it look cheap, although the parts and pieces individually are well made.

The box is the nicest part of the set.

The fabric feels nice and soft though. I felt comfortable wearing this even during a very hot and sunny day in FL. Color looks good, and exactly like the product photo. Just wish it had more shape to it because if you have wide shoulders like I do and an inverted triangle body shape, you'll look very boxy unless you go down a size (this is very stretchy). The plus side is, the fabric doesn't seem like it would show any lumps or bumps even of you go down a size.","Runs a tad big, good fabirc, though."

3,"First, the good. The leather is nice, and of the appropriate weight. The hardware looks good and matches well with my watch  (Seiko 5 automatic).
The bad. The stitching is of poor quality. While putting my watch on the band, I noticed a broken stitch that was pulling apart, and when I looked closer, another stitch line was also pulling apart. Machine stitching alone is not appropriate for short runs in leather. Better would be if it was glued first. Best is a proper double needle hand stitch. The last is not likely at this price point, so a quick dab of glue at the stitching line would be appropriate. I pulled the stitching and resewed it by hand, it's just fine now. Also, this strap comes in a clear sleeve with two new pins, but no documentation whatsoever. No instructions, no pictures of it installed, nothing. And the manufacturers website is equally lacking. It was easy to figure out, but some kind of confirmation would be nice.
The odd. One of the rings was installed backward (cut ends facing out). It's not functionally significant, but it looks wrong. Since that was where the broken stitching was, I flipped it before resewing. And I'm really not sure why there are two oval rings at the end of the short strap. As near as I can tell, it's purely a for looks.
In all, it's a nice strap, and will likely last a long time after I made some quick fixes. But the assembly shows a lack of attention to quality.","It's a nice strap, but..."

Pros:  The quality of the sock itself seems fine.  They are thick and appear durable.  They haven't pilled much after multiple washings and the color hasn't faded.

Cons:  These socks are probably about an inch too long in the foot for him, which I expected to happen, what I didn't expect is that they're tight on his calves.  These socks would probably be way too tight at the cuff for a full grown man.",tight in calf

She has a different size and is more endowed than myself but we both agree its a little big. Love the color though which is a sort of pink melon. The small at 42 inches chest fits more like a normal large scrub top so I'd say that unlike the reviews on the other version of this print this one does not run small but runs bigger.,Its a little big up top

The right foot seems smaller than the left (which is odd, because my left foot is actually the larger of my feet) and even though they were marked the same, it almost seems they were differently sized.  The style is nice and the they are leather uppers, so I'm hoping over time they will break in.",The style is nice and the they are leather uppers

3,"Boots fit well and they are very comfortable. They hold up the my abuse well.  Motorcycle riding,  tree planting,  digging,  and general fun stuff. They clean up well too.  I love the thick sole.

Update: I bought these in February. Now,  in November, I have to revise my initial review. In one fell swoop, almost the entire sole of one of these boots peeled away.  It ripped a slit down the middle of the bottom as well when it came away,  so glue will not fix it. While they were comfy and good while they lasted,  they really don't have the staying power I'd hoped. I think I'm finally going to break down and get some Redwings.",Boots fit well and they are very comfortable. They hold up the my abuse well

3,"These are cute gloves and they work for what I need so I would love to give 5 stars but they just aren't quite there. But they are also quite cheap so I'm a little torn.. much like my gloves.
1. They have a slit for the thumb to also be a half finger but because of the fit that slit never really closes leaving an odd feeling and looking thumb.
2. They are already unraveling a bit at the thumbs which is sad as I've only worn them twice.
3. If you should choose to flip the adorable grey ""full finger mitten"" part over your fingers you'll find it a tight fit. Now in fairness I haven't worn mittens since I was a child so maybe they all feel so confining, but I would have to be really cold to use that option.","Probably won't last too long, but cute while they last."

I have tried to wet the shoes and wear thick socks (a miserable day) and it stretched them some, but not enough.  One other problem is the material absorbs any mud you might get splashed on them.

3,"These Mr. Swim trunks fit well and look pretty good.  I like the non-elastic waistband and drawstring front, and the mesh liner is softer than most swim trunks I've owned.

Now it is borderline too tight to wear, and I haven't even gotten one use out of it (and probably cannot return it anyway since the tag is taken off).

3,"Bought this for my daughter and tried it on her. Not exactly the best quality and the size 2 was a bit snug (she wears 18-24 month clothes), but it looked cute on her. I did take the flower off though. I mean the thing was put on it with a safety pin and it just added to the cheap feel of the dress. Trying to zip this dress up was a pain too. It's hard to tell if the zipper was to blame or if it was because the dress was snug on her. Last but not least, the packaging was pitiful. It was pretty much just stuffed in a bag. I gave it 3 stars though because it does look decent and she seems to like it so I guess that's all that matters.","Cute, but cheaply made"

I would suggest that you buy it from spibelt (same price) directly because the vendor/seller that amazon used does not send the correct size product!

I've never used a synthetic boot before so I am open to try them! They look a little cheap. My first impression is that you have to choose your true size. Only half up size if you use thick socks during Winter. But I don't know if vynil or synthetics would be useful for Winter (snow or rain). I ordered a size up but there no more cold. I'll try thiner socks or a inner sole. The faux leather can look as thick paper at the top of the boot when it is unfolded. I think because it was folded. It can get a Little bulky while seated.
It can be used unfolded and would be a very good option too. It's warm (I think a Little too warm for summer). It has the same strap and buttons so you can keep the design.
I was a little hesitant about the color but they look amazing. The sole is think plastic hopefully non slip. I have to try them in the rain first! No arch support at all :(",I love them so far!!
3,"The layers of the sole started to come apart and caused me to trip a few times before realizing that I wasn't simply having a clumsy day. I put epoxy in there and it's holding up okay, but looks odd if you look closely.

I have a C-Cup & ordered a size small. It's a type of stretch material (not ordinary T-Shirt material) but I feel like a size medium would have been too big.

I measured it to be 6.5"" on each side of the necklace totaling 13"". I'm an average height/weight female and this is essentially a choker-style necklace as is. The chain also looks cheap and of a style I would expect on a $10 necklace from a mass-market accessories store. One side of the metal bracket holding the stones also has a black spot on it, as though it was damaged by heat or something. It will not come off.

3,"I have purchased several G-Shock watches over the years, and I have enjoyed all of them for one reason or another.  I purchased the GA-400-9BJF, because of the colors.  I wanted a watch to wear to college games, and my college colors are navy blue and yellow.  This watch fit the color purpose, but otherwise this isn't a very interesting watch.  On the main screen, it gives you the month, day of the month, day of the week, and the time.  The time is given in both a digital display and with analog hour and minute hands.  The watch comes with a stop watch, a countdown timer, and five alarms (one with a snooze).  You are also able to check out the time in other time zones.  The watch comes with a battery instead of tough solar charging and doesn't have an atomic time setting function.  I have two cons for this watch.  First, is the illumination.  For a couple of decades we have had back lighting available, and all my G-Shocks have this feature, which makes it really easy to see the time in the dark.  Instead of this kind of helpful illumination, this watch has a little LED light that shines in from the bottom.  It is difficult to make out the time and impossible to see the date information in the dark.  My other con is that this pretty basic watch is being sold for $150 or above.  There are much better G-Shocks with much better features being sold for less, so unless you want the color combination, as I did, I can't recommend buying this watch.",A basic watch

It even comes with a warning label to that effect. I bought a size smaller based on the other reviews, and it  is still a little bigger that I would have liked. The dress is lined, but the lining tends to ride up over the bust line because the outer material tends to droop from its own weight, around the neck and armholes.  the material lets this dress down.

3,Costume was purchased for my 18 month old nephew. It was a good fit (we were able to layer clothes underneath since October can be chilly here in NYC) and he looked adorable. I would recommend sizing up since my nephew is a little on the smaller side and wearing about a size 12m at the time. Overall the costume was decent quality and was very cute. The only downside was the hat was a little odd fitting and the boot covers need to be worn with boots (there needs to be a little bit of a separation by the heel) or else they will fall off (they won't work well with sneakers).,Cute costume.

3,"I actually ordered 2 different sizes, one based on my measurements using Active Basic's sizing chart and a size larger. My measurements are approx 31, 28, 35 so I ordered the large and a 1XL.
The L before and after washing is very skin tight, but since the fabric is rather stretchy, it's really not too uncomfortable.
The 1XL before and after washing fits perfectly. (I still find it sad that as kind of ""small"" as I am, an extra large is considered comfortable and a perfect fit. But such is the way of women's fashion/sizing).
The material is quite soft, and is very breathable. It's also a bit see-thru, which is fine for me since I wear it under scrubs :)

1. The strap on the back is secured by velcro. A buckle would have been nicer
2. Around where the velcro is attached you can see where it was glued then wiped off. No one would notice while you're wearing them, but for such expensive shoes it seems like they could have done better.
3. The top corner of the shoe that wraps around above your heel is a sharp corner. Not sharp as in it hurts, but since it's leather I worry it will lose its shape after wearing for a while and curl or become floppy.",Not sure whether I will return or keep.

I tried to install according to the directions but I found it easier to just roll up the ends of the laces and put the threaded post on with superglue. While the shafts stayed on, the aglet caps wouldn't screw all the way on. As soon as I wore them outside, the aglets all fell off before I realized what was happening.

The size chart for this suit lists 36.5 to 38.5 inches for height and 31 to 34 lbs for weight for the 3T, and I found this to be pretty accurate. My son is slightly shorter than the listed range, and the suit is (appropriately) very slightly long on him.

The quality is nice and the suit looks great on him, so I expect to get use out of it through the start of next summer.

I knocked this down from 5 stars to 3 stars. It was a great suit, but after about 4  or 5 wears the seams have started to come apart, mostly around the sleeves.

3,"I absolutely love the look of these shoes. I so need them for my 50th birthday party in June. However, I've gone through two different styles from ""Velcans"" and two different sizes. Normally I'm a size 6 1/2. Reading reviews I saw that many suggested to order 1/2 size up, I then ordered a size 7. Shoe was still too tight. I then returned them for a size 7 1/2 and they were too big!
I then switched to THIS STYLE. Same problem. I am keeping the size 7 and trying to stretch them myself. This is the perfect shoe that I needed and I cant find anything similar. I hate that it's so expensive and I now have to pay a cobbler to try to stretch these shoes. Another disappointing was that they came in with a few missing rhinestones. They were not even in the box. However they do include a small bag of extra rhinestones so now I also have to pay for them to be put on. Lord knows what will happen to the rhinestones when they shoes get stretched. They are beautiful and well made but Velcans need to get their sizes corrected.",I absolutely love the look of these shoes

3,"The picture does not do this beautiful ring justice.  I was concerned about the color of the stone, as the picture makes it look kind of cheesy (natural aquamarines are very pale blue).

The shafts are much more dainty than they appear in the picture, and really let the stone stand out.  The band itself is wide enough to be substantial but not too wide, which would get in the way or affect sizing.  The size fits perfectly.  I could not be happier!

One, It's too expensive. There are other comparable bags that are much less money. Two, I'd prefer to get a canvas bag that does't involve ""harvesting"" animals for their skin for my vanity. Three, its pockets are not secure, which in such an expensive bag is really inexcusable. The two pockets are wide upon, with no zipper, velcro, or snaps. Four, the shoulder strap is not removable, which is odd because the handle is. It's really the shoulder strap that you'd potentially want to remove and yet you can't. I also did not like how easily the leather shows the slightest marks.

I work in film and costuming so I was very excited to get a durable resin mask of my favourite character. Opening the package today was a severe disappointment.

That said, it does fit well and is actually white (a lot of these tend to be yellowish) though some people said it sat far enough away from your face so your eyes wouldn't be visible and that is certainly NOT the case.

Her marshmallow shirt lost the heart in the chat bubble after one wash, and after 5 or so washes it developed a tear in the fabric in the middle of the marshmallow body;  most of the marshmallow body looks very worn now, like it's 15 years old.

Gotta say, I didn't think I'd like them so much when she made me buy them, but a couple of months later, I'm sad to say it feels like chocolate's wife died.  I'm kinda depressed.  I'd buy a new marshmallow shirt, but you have to buy them as a pair, and then I still have this widower chocolate t-shirt laying around.

3,"The quality is kind of cheap. I went 1/4 size up when I ordered these (I am right at the cusp between a size 5 and a 5 1/2) because I wanted to be able to wear thick winter socks inside. I wasn't expecting too much in the way of lining, especially in the foot because most boots of that type I've had don't have such lining. They only give the illusion of being winter boots. These are average in that respect. Some warmth in the leg part of the boot, zero in the foot part. So it's good to have room for warm socks inside. However, there is also very little cushioning and not sufficient support. Even when I wear socks and the boot fits. I solved that problem by adding gel insoles. That improved the comfort 100%. So now I have a good pair of winter boots. The lacing detail on the side of the boot has a tendency to come undone. I'll have to put a stitch in there.",Not the best quality and comfort but OK
3,Not for short people! Haha,Three Stars
3,Just so so,Three Stars
3,"When I went to order this the first time it was sold out, so I was so excited to see it back in. It came in quickly, but after waiting for something so long and to be disappointed with it was a let-down.  The shirt was much thinner than expected and fit was much smaller than expected.  I usually wear between a large and x-large. Because it was a t-shirt and it could be a little sloppier, I ordered the x-large. No way, it was way too snug. I gave it to my daughter who wears a size 10 and it just fit. The German Shepherd was so cute and looks just like mine, so I was very disappointed, but my daughter was happy with it.",Disappointed
3,This is a cute boot and I have only had it a day but when I put it on I knew right away that it would not work for me. The footbed feels like a piece of cardboard. I put my own orthotic in it but I am still concerned that it may not keep my feet dry. Also the zipper got stuck and I think is was because it is a poor quality zipper. These may work for you if your looking for a cheap pair of boots but I had to return them.,Cute boot but not the quality I had hoped for.

3,"After only 2 days of use, I have mixed feelings about this bag. It was bought to replace a Lowe Pro Alpine guide bag that they don't make any more. It was a bit smaller in the height and width and a lot smaller in the thickness. Although this bag is larger, it really doesn't pack any better for some reason. This product page shows the dimensions three times. They are all different. They are all wrong. The actual size checked with a tape measure is 10-1/2"" x 8-1/2"" x 3-1/2"".

First the pros...
It has the usual Victorinox signature quality that we expect in their products. From the materials, fit, finish and feel, you know this is made way better than your average bag. The side zip-out mesh pocket works well for smaller water bottles. Just don't expect to fit a liter container in there.

Now the cons (and there are surprisingly quite a few)...
Zippers:
All three zippers are single pull. That means to take things out of the front patch pocket or main compartment, you have to zip them completely open. I may not want folks around me to see the entire contents of my bag to take something out. The single pulls had bigger design impact though.
As you face the front of the bag, the zipper opens from left to right. Imagine wearing the bag on your left side, you zip up from the front to the  rear. While this is OK for a right hander, it makes it almost unusable to wear on your right side where a typical left hander would carry it.
The bag lacks a pass though hole for your headphone cable. Usually this is not such a big deal as you slide the double zipper to convenient position and pass the cable between them. With this single pull set up, the cable has to come out of the bottom font of the bag. It's also not a good idea to leave it zipped up a little because small things could fall out of the bottom of the bag.

Strap:
The strap is not removable. It comes with two Velcro straps to hold it in place when you don't want to use it. But it's still there and it's in the way.
The fixed strap leads to another problem. The strap is attached to the bag at an angle that is perfect for cross body use. Wearing it over one shoulder is another thing. The strap holds the top of the bag away from your body because of the angle it's sewn. Given the choice of a better fit for one or the other, I would have picked over the shoulder.

Conclusion:
I'll carry this a couple of more days to see if I like it any more with time. If not, it will be returned if something better can be found.",Some basic design choices compromise its usefulness
3,"Water resistant. But, smells like polyurethane or something else bad. Usable in cool weather. Not recommended for any long time walking with this worn as a backpack. Because it gets hot and sweaty really quick. I only gave this 3 stars for the small zip bag.

Very disappointed.,Not what I expected.

3,"These are very lightweight boat shoes, mainly due to having very thin leather construction (almost feels like pleather). This creates the low weight but it's sacrificing a solid, supportive feel like more expensive boat shoes (i.e. Sperry, Sebago, et al). The memory foam is flat so no arch support at all. They were very uncomfortable to me until I swapped the insoles out with my worn out Sebago boat shoe insoles. Now they feel great! I'm not sure how durable they will be over the long haul due to the thin leather so that's why I gave them only 3 stars.","Low price, low weight but hardly any support."

3,I love the material and it's well made.  I bought the 2X as I usually wear XL.  It was way too small.  2X is supposed to be 80cm but I measured it and it's actually 86cm but still too small.

3,"One of the sides of the scarf/mitten is much longer than the other. This is so you can wrap it around your neck and over your shoulder, which will secure the hood closed and make the scarf same length as the other side. The problem is it is that the mittens end up above your waist and you walk around with your elbows bent and hands up, which is only great if you are playing piano, and then the hood becomes too tight around the face. This would explain why the girl in the picture is holding up her hands---it's to avoid strangling herself.

Too bad, it is well made, soft and super cute, but just not functional. It ships from China, so good luck returning it.

An actual size photo, and one of the side view showing the post and back (for perspective) would have really helped. I'm leaning toward returning the earrings because I don't feel like they are worth as much as I paid. (They are approximately 1/2 x 1/8 inch.) On a more positive note, the earrings were well packaged and were shipped promptly.",earrings smaller than expected

HOW IT FITS: These white jeans are in the Kimmie Crop which is more of a ""mom jeans"" fit (see pictures) and not a skinny fit at all. This is okay for a more full figure but the ANKLE SKINNY fits me much better. For reference, I am 5'2"" and 115 lbs.

HOW IT FEELS: These are very nice jeans and really well made. The materials looks great in person and look premium. Not a fan of the loose fit.

HOW IT LOOKS: Looks great with casual and dressy shoes and I can wear it with a blouse or even a hooded sweatshirt.

OVERALL: I'm not a fan of these because they look like ""Mom jeans"" to me. I would go with the 7 For All Mankind Women's Ankle Skinny Jean with Destroy, Distressed Authentic Light, 29 which fits better and looks much better! Same brand but the ANKLE SKINNY is more of a slim fit jean!

The hat did come folded up in a plastic shipping  bag, however there is no funky smell as other reviewers have mentioned. The hat is misshapen though and it will require some work to get it back into shape.
I tried the hat on immediately upon arrival and I'm struggling to figure out how to shape it. It doesn't look exactly like the picture, it's kind of a cross between a fedora and small sun hat with a little cowboy hat twist...

3,It's a fine shirt except for the fact that it has a square Carhartt logo over on the flap of the left breast pocket as opposed to the more subtle little sideways tag that is advertised.  I'm tempted to return it for this reason alone because it's exactly what I was trying to avoid when bought the shirt because I was planning to have it embroidered with my company's emblem.,Tag is not as shown.  Buyer beware.
3,"This is a nice sized bag and I expected good quality as this is from Gwen Stefani.  The bag itself is good style, very deep but it has odd inside pockets that are pretty high to be practical and a detachable inside baggie, good sized but there is no way to use it as a clutch as the strap is too short to clip nicely onto itself as a wristlet.  Kind of pointless but it works inside the bag, probably for your money or makeup.  The handles leave something to be desired.  I barely started wearing this bag over the weekend and I noticed the fray on the handle.  It was probably ill made but since I had already used it, I am not going to bother returning it.  Not worth the price I paid for a bag with a defective strap.  I am disappointed with the brand as I had very high hopes for GX by Gwen Stefani Handbags.  Maybe if this was on a better sale it would be OK but one still doesn't expect the poor quality from this brand.  I've uploaded some close up shots of the strap.  Its embarrassing that this happened and its less than 2 weeks old.","Nice looking, but poor craftsmanship."

3,"These socks are very interesting. I went out on a whim to get them and I have mixed feelings about them.

Pros:
-->They are plenty long
-->They are comfortable

Cons:
-->I could hear the threads snapping while I was putting them on so I have to question their longevity
-->They are very thin. I can see my toes through the sock which really makes me question their longevity
-->The colors are wild, but this isn't really too much of a con. I like ""loud"" socks personally.
-->The colors of the four pair you get are chosen at random. I received the blue, red, peach, and beige pair. I was hoping to get a few of the other more attractive colors instead.

Overall, I don't think I would buy them again. If you like the patterns, they are alright socks, but I don't think they're for me.

3,"I have 3 other Invicta watches.  I'm happy with the appearance of the others, but this one did not excite me.  The colors look cheap to me.  The gold especially looks like something you would find on a 1980's sink faucet.  My final issue was when it came to sizing the band.  I purchased the GGI International Watch Repair Tool Kit from Amazon and have used it without any issues to adjust the metal bands on 4 other watches.  The holes on this band are incredibly small and the standard tool would not drive the pins out without causing damage to the band.  I had to improvise another tool from the kit, which wasn't intended for pin removal.  It ended up working, but was ruined in the process because the other side was not meant to be hammered.",Not thrilled / Band links difficult to remove with standard removal tool

3,"I was initially happy with this bag - especially the ease of access to stuff in the front pocket, and the laptop pocket.  After about 3 months of use, however, two of the zipper pulls have come apart.  This has occurred in a strange way:  The metal part of the zipper pull, with very light use, has gradually separated from the zipper and now has broken off on two pulls.  Certainly for the price, I would have thought the zipper pulls would have been better for a brand like Nixon.",Was initially happy with it... now not so much.
3,"I ended up having to return these. Despite reading reviews saying these were okay for larger calfed women because they lace up, they kept riding down below my calfs and then just kinda bunched up there.

3,As others have said it scrapes the back of my heel. I used  a shoe stretcher for the left on because my toe was getting a blister. I stretched out the right one and still digs into the back of my heel. I taped a foam piece to the back and it helped. Very little arch support and had to buy gel arch supports to help with that. Disappointed in dansko.,Ouch!!
3,Took about 1 month from the day I placed my order to receive them. I usually wear a medium. These were certainly smaller. The bands aren't very elastic so they don't stretch. Since they don't stretch the stitching rips when you pull them down or up.

About the only thing that I prefer is more length for the torso.  Being 3x is not a typical body size anyway, but I thought being from the Big and Tall line of clothing there would be extra length extending into the waist for us bigger guys.  Not so much.  As it is now I need to wear suspenders to keep everything in place so my lower gut doesn't peek out.  Sucks to be me - I know.  I don't need the reminder.",The cut could of been a bit more generous

3,"Very poor quality stitching.  The skirt was so cute and the material was perfect (light weight just as described)  The problem was the quality of the sewing.  The stitching was crooked at the waist.  The waist is just a simple piece of elastic and the skirt material  edge was just simply a serge stitch sewn onto the elastic.  It wouldn't have lasted very long on my daughter if she used it for play which is what it was intended for.
As far as the size goes:  The medium fit my 7 year old daughter perfect.  She is a 22 inch waist and is about 59"" tall.  It  was the perfect length, a little below mid-calf.  Wish the quality was better as it is very cute and full.",Nice material but very poor quality stitching.

3,"I am a seasoned Ugg's slippers kind of guy, having owned several pairs and LOVING them. They really have to get their sizing figured out though. These slippers are way too small, despite me ordering a size 12 when an 11 is usually good with any other shoe. I should have got a 13 and they would have been perfect. These slippers don't feel like slippers to me. They look and feel much more like a shoe and I wasn't comfortable putting my feet up on any furniture while wearing them as it felt too much like I was wearing outdoor shoes.  My other pair of these slippers (check my recent review of the gray pair) are much better.  They are lighter, more flexible and overall much more suited to the title ""slipper"".
These shoes come with 2 sets of insoles. One sheepskin and the other is a smooth, flat sole that is the same color as the sole. I could not even get my foot in to the shoe with the sheepskin inserts so tried the other set.  They fit OK but I had to wear them a couple of time for a few hours to loosen them up. One thing that I know from past experience is that they DO loosen up, if you can be bothered to wear them a few times first. For their usual, very high price, I would not tolerate this but this pair were $54 so I decided to go through it as the shoes are of very high quality and are not very comfortable indeed.  I really do love Uggs slippers but these are more like shoes and I am keeping them to wear as shoes. If Ugg's were to advise of the sizing issues, these would be 5 star shoes.",despite me ordering a size 12 when an 11 is usually good with any other shoe

The fabric is clingy and I was hoping for loose falling satin like a vintage piece that it is seemingly made to look like. Tummy area is tighter than I would like.

3,"I had trouble deciding between three and four stars but went with three so as not to oversell them to someone else. They are good quality, nice supple leather and very good sole. But I gave them only three stars for two reason. First, the entire boot is lined with a layer of thick material - which would be fine for the shaft but it's also in the foot part. This makes it a good half size smaller if you want to wear anything but the thinnest sock or leggings with them. And in our Midwest winters, I want warm feet which means socks inside my boots. This lining also sticks to whatever you're wearing on your feet, so what you have on your feet - be it socks, leggings, nylons, whatever - ends up pulled back tightly toward your heels and scrunches your toes up. In my bare feet, they slide on fine and fit like an 8 1/2 but I'm not wearing them barefooted.
Secondly, the zipper in back was for some reason I will never understand outlined in an orangish-yellow color - it's very noticeable and makes it look like you have double yellow no-passing lines running up the entire back of the boot - to me, it's a very strange look and not one I'd choose.

3,"I twice had to return these boots. My normal boot size was far too large (full size). Upon getting the right length boot, the toe area was too narrow and the heel was jammed in the back of the boot. There's like a nook for the heel to fit in. They rubbed my heels uncomfortably. The leather is nice and the lambskin lining is soft and seems durable. Good stitching too. No cheap bootlaces here. These are thick and should last a while.

However, I couldn't get past the narrowness of the front half of the boot once I had the right length. I walked in them on three different surfaces in the house in three different types of socks. Nothing was overall comfortable.","Well Made, Too Narrow"

It was just right from the waist down & a little long for my height.  The shoulders and bust area were 2 sizes too large.  Plus the chunky zipper was heavy and didn't sit on my chest right.

3,"Four things:

1. I ordered this in the red because I loved the cherry red color in the photo. What arrived was a tomato red, much brighter. If you prefer a more orange red, you will like the color. But I wanted a more blue red like in the photo, and that's not what I got.

2. Based on the reviews, I checked the sizing and ordered a size up. That was a mistake - the bikini felt like a full two sizes big. These don't run small and they're extremely stretchy. I would suggest buying your regular size or even go a size down. Nothing looks worse than a baggy bikini. You're better off going a bit tight (and swimsuits expand in the water anyway).

3. The bottom was cute, nice and high waisted and probably would have contoured my stomach and hips nicely had it fit properly. The top, however, was terrible. The cups are tiny and thin and way too soft for the size of the bra. This is a plus-sized swimsuit - any woman in a plus size will need more support than that! I was able to get some lift by tying the straps tight around my neck, but that resulted in a terrible neck ache. There are bandeau tops that work well for large boobs. This isn't one of them. If you're bigger than a C cup, this will look terrible.

4. The material was surprising good quality for the price. Both the top and bottom are lined, and the fabric is soft and smooth. Very little shine to it, which I prefer.",These don't run small and are extremely stretchy

3,"I bought two sizes too big because the other reviews complained about crotch area.  It fits the crotch, but everywhere else is very long (especially the feet) and folds everywhere.  I will alter the arms and legs.  I bought the purple for a 1960s Batgirl cosplay, but it is pretty much pink.  The picture has obviously been edited to remove as much pink shine as possible so the seller can call it ""purple"".  This is very misleading and now i'm going to look very silly as i do not have time to order a new suit somewhere else.  I do like how sturdy the garment is though.  It feels like it can handle many walks around a convention.  I'm a large usually and I bough a XXL.",Not the purple I was going for...
3,"My pre-teen daughter  is quite self consious about her developing body and for her this bathing suit felt too low cut in the front and made her very self conscious. It did go pretty low, below the breast line, and I probably wouldn't feel comfortable with it either. She said she'd never feel comfortable wearing it around others as she felt the cut emphasized her breasts which, according to her ""is sooo embarrassing - like I'm trying to draw attention or something"".  It's really too bad as the fabric is very attractive and other than the low cut aspect the suit is really cute.

If your girl hasn't started puberty yet then the cut of the suit probably wouldn't be any big deal.",Cute fabric but my pre-teen was uncomfortable with how low the V was so we sent it back

3,"You're definitely paying for the logo.
I've had these shoes for 6 months. I wear them 2-3 days a week to work, sometimes when I run errands on the weekends- nothing to strenuous, no running, no outdoor hiking.

The outside has held up well. The plastic design hasn't cracked, and the soles still look good. However, the inside looks like...crap. The pink material on the inside has become unstitched, and there are holes in the material at the heel.

Summary: the shoes are comfy, they look cute, but the material used could be improved. I wouldn't recommend them for any type of exercise.","Cute, but short lived"
3,I have had many compliments on this pendant and I like it as well . I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that the clear protective coating has worn off after 8 months of wear .

3,I wanted a fuchsia tote to match my luggage and this fit the description.  It is a little more narrow than I wanted  for in a tote  but still a very nice summer bag. It is a quilted cloth not leather so not sure how it will stand up to travel having to place items on floor. Pretty & looks exactly like picture but considering  exchanging,Smaller Tote
3,"Product is pretty and as described. It does however bother me a bit that the logo is set a bit off center and is a tiny bit crooked.  I figure for this price I shouldn't have to deal with that. It was too much of a hassle to exchange it just for that reason though. The description warns about this in a vague way so will state it clearly here. The butterflies will not be the same as in the picture.  I was fine with that since I expected it but still preferred the picture they posted.

However, the bag is really, really small -- much smaller than expected and CANNOT fit an adult jacket in there, let along a swingpack and poncho.  Main compartment is 10""h x 8""w x 2.5""d.  I guess if you count the front, zippered pocket and top strap, the overall dimensions are greater.  If you're looking for a toddler backpack or just for an iPad, book, or wallet, this may work.

The pockets are very shallow, I have a droid mini and I'm not comfortable leaving it in my pocket without holding it. The fit is fine except for the shoulders.. way too narrow and tight. There's no full range of motion, which is irritating. I'm 5'3, 140lbs and I ordered a large based on reviews. If you want a snug fit buy your normal size, but the arm and shoulder fit probably won't line up.

The buttons on this version (with the yellow ring) are black and not easy to see.  The other version's colors are ghastly but probably are seen  better and hence quicker to use during starts.  Finally the wrist band is a 2 piece elastic with a plastic clasp that doesn't inspire confidence.  I sewed 2 pieces together.,OK; not great

I had to cut the wig myself, and this was my first time cutting a wig. I cut it extremely short and I got really upset. But it was my fault.

It's super odd looking- doesn't look like it does on the model.  I'm 5'9"" and an 18/20 in women's- so there really should not be a lot of excess material on me when I order a 2x.

The backpack option was VERY comfortable and the shoulder strap was also practical and comfortable.  The problem, for me, was with the front flap, which was awkward and got in the way.  Especially when the bag was being used on the shoulder and wasn't full, it would sag a little, which was fine, but would cause the front flap to buckle and stick out strangely.  The color was great and the bag material felt strong.  The only other thing was the front snap seemed a bit difficult to work with and caused the fabric to stretch a bit around it.  Maybe this wouldn't have been a problem.  I didn't keep it, so I'm not sure how it would have held up.  Without the flap, I would have kept the bag!",I liked many things about this bag

The color of the one I received is just slightly darker than the one in the picture, but it's not off by much. I would call it a hunter green, certainly.
I found it a bit itchy, but I don't know how it would be after washing. The sleeves are sufficiently long, and they have some stretch to them, so I think they are designed to hug the wearers' arms.

3,"If the watch was as stated in the product info section it would rate 4 1/2 stars. The band looks like its good quality.it has micro adjustment holes in the clasp so that you can adjust it for a good fit. The bezel turns smoothly without a lot of effort.

Did not feel like a more expensive watch. Well you only have to reset the time a few. times a year. My other con's were in the specs,it says that the watch uses a nonstandard battery . What the heck does that mean??? My last problem is the fact that the description of the watch says the the case is stainless steel  while the stamping on the back of the case says stainless steel case back. This usually means that the rest of the case is not stainless steel but chrome plated base metal. If you plan on keeping this watch a long time, the chrome can wear thru or show corrosion after a while.

They don't necessarily run big to me, they just fit wide around the ankle. I'm a perfect 7. Ordered a 6.5. Fit just right length wise, but bulged out at the top of my ankle.
I ended up returning them and going with my original choice for $20 more. It's worth it to get what I really wanted. But if I didn't have my mind set on the CL, these would be a cute decent pair as well.

3,"I bought this watch for its aesthetics and it does not disappoint. The appearance and color scheme are great. There is a silver strip that sits under the winder which breaks up the distressed steel and gives it that extra pop.
It is on the big side at 46cm. Due to the thick double band bracelet, the watch hovers over your wrist a good bit, about .5 cm, which may be unapealing to some. There are some noticable negatives. The calendar date is noticably submerged under the dial, as a result, the dial often casts a shadow on part of the date. Additionally, the calendar is a microscopic 2 cm in diameter. Because of these two factors, you have to hold the watch right up to your face to be able to read the date. Lastly, the quality of the watch band is a little lacking.

3,"Picture is not an accurate representation of the dress.  It is very much a prom-dress, with a very poofy tulle skirt.  I ordered the green dress thinking it was either a dark peridot or light sage shade as pictures, it isn't.  The green dress is a very yellow-green, bright, springy, neon yellow-green.  I also had the issue that in spite of all the measurements, the one measurement that was not requested was arm circumference.  Consequently, the sleeves don't fit me either and rather than alter the dress, I'm asking to return it.  In spite of the arms not fitting, the dress is very well constructed, beautifully made, and excellent quality.  I would order from this company again if I found a different style that was more appropriate for ballroom dance performance.","Green color not as pictured, sleeves don't fit"

The angora content as advertised though quite rough- these may well be from angora goats rather than the soft bunnies as I'd expected. I'd put these in the back of my drawer unimpressed (at first glance I'd have rated them a 1-2*) until I read rabbit angora can help arthritic feet so I wore them though scratchy and the toe seam is a bit unpleasant and was pleasantly surprised because they provide great warmth to my very cold feet (I have Raynaud's disease & arthritis). Now I do wear them often though it took getting used to the scratchiness. They do soften up slightly after some wear.

The strap across the forefoot pinches my toes and I know that this will be a problem with how long I can wear them.

3,"I bought these elsewhere, but I've had them about a year.  I like the glasses, they fit well and they still snap open and closed just great.

However, within the first month or two my sunglass lenses were all scratched up.  I was traveling around South Africa and they went into my pocket or a backpack several times.  This isn't my first rodeo with a pair of sunglasses..  I expect the lenses to hold up pretty well, (especially on $100 glasses) and be able to deflect some normal contact with more items than just cotton or silk...  I've always made sunglasses last and I almost never drop them.  The scratches are not due to dropping. -But the lenses should withstand some dropping regardless. And I didn't knock them against rocks for fun...  These glasses quickly took the back seat to looking good occasions, and now I only wear them driving or hiking.  Not happy about it.
Anyway, I was hoping it wouldn't be a big issue and I could just get some replacement lenses for a reasonable cost.  NOPE.  Company website says they do NOT MAKE REPLACEMENT LENSES.
Quote from Von Zipper website:
""REPLACEMENT SUNGLASS LENSES
So you've been shredding too hard and your sunglass lenses have seen better days? Unfortunately we've got some less than exciting news... VonZipper sunglasses and lenses are manufactured together and we do not currently manufacture or sell replacement lenses. It may just be time to throw in the towel and pick up a new pair...""

4,"I have another Lucky Brand bag that I like a lot (The Rickey Hobo w/fringe) so when I saw the great price on this one in the oyster color I did not hesitate to order it. I am happy that it is also a bit larger than my first one which looks generously sized but really doesn't hold as many items as I thought it would (probably a good thing, because over the last year or so, I have somehow gone from someone who carries a set of keys and an ID to someone loaded down with all sorts of 'necessities')! This new bag is actually one of my larger purses, although the fact that it has a fairly slim profile and doesn't have a flat bottom helps prevent it from being massive. I can easily fit everything I would want to carry with room to spare and I like that this bag closes with a zipper (my other one has a snap closure which is nice, but tends to gap open if I have too much stuff in it). The color is great--on my monitor this looks very light, almost an egg-shell, but the one I received is darker in tone--kind of a creamy ivory but with pale beige rather than yellowish undertones. I think it will age very nicely and look even more interesting as it does so. I like the fringe--it is more understated than my other fringed bag, so perhaps a bit more versatile. I'm not entirely pleased with the shoulder strap--I do think it could be a bit wider and thicker for a bag of this size & with the weight it will probably need to support...it is not quite 2 cm wide, so about 3/4"" compared to one and a half inches and padded for the hand-held strap which I am sure will hold up well. This is not a deal-breaker for me given the sale price on this item, but this is definitely something I might think twice about it if I had paid full price. If the long strap doesn't last, I will just remove it. I do prefer a long strap to carry my bag at the hip, but it is also possible to wear the bag over the shoulder with the shorter strap, in case someone would like to remove the longer strap but doesn't want to carry it in their hand or at the elbow. The only other downside to this purse is that when it arrived it was imbued with a rather smoky scent--kind of like poorly processed beeswax. It is not terribly strong and not entirely unpleasant but I definitely want to get rid of it--not sure if it is a leftover from the tanning/manufacturing process? or maybe the reason why this is being offered at such a bargain price? I've never encountered this before. I have had it hanging in the house to air out for a couple of days, and I think it is lessening (or I'm just getting used to it) but it is still detectable. I plan to hang it outdoors for a while tomorrow to see if that helps. I will update this review if I am unable to remove the scent within the next few days.","Pros = Large bag, light-weight & nice design--trim is not 'too much' IMO Cons = thin strap + mine has a smoky scent..."

4,Gorgeous dress. The top portion across the shoulders was a bit big along with the waist line. This was problematic since it caused the top portion above the cut-out to droop and flip slightly.

4,"So I knew going in that this watch was going to be large - I just didn't realize just how large. I'm an average sized guy with average sized wrist; this watch is large enough on me that it's almost overwhelming.

I do like this watch. The shape is distinctive and very different from all the others I have. The details and design are classy looking and good looking. The winding mechanism (both the wind up via the crown and through kinetic energy work well. And it keeps good time (so far so good, but I'll have to see what it's like in the long run - I have many watches so will be wearing this one infrequently; only time will tell just how well it operates over the long run).

The leather band is nicely made. It's not too stiff or too soft.

One thing concerns me very greatly - the watch doesn't seem to be perfectly sealed. I noticed condensation on the inside when moving from an AC controlled space into the outside heat. I know that this watch is not supposed to be waterproof; however, it should still be water resistant. I'm worried that I will not be able to wear this watch if there's even a chance of rain.

Other than being so large on me and appearing to have some condensation issues, I'm pretty happy with this watch.",Good Looking But Very Large

If you order, and there is a discrepancy in the type (women's vs girl's), make sure you order larger than needed.  Otherwise, love the shirts, the texture and the way they wash.

4,"Although ""nice, for what it is"" may sound like damning with faint praise, this bag is well worth a look. Yes, it's made of a synthetic material, but so was your high school gym bag, and you loved that thing, right?  It offers good organization without going pocket-crazy, the fold-down handles are a nice touch that enhance walkability, and the black-with-stripes design looks great. While the dimensions say ""briefcase"" the look and material make it very versatile--it can work as an all-purpose man bag (including gym duty), especially for those times when you need to carry a fair amount of stuff. The man-made material comes in handy in this respect, as well, since, empty, the bag is very light, unlike leather bags that can weigh you down before you put anything in them. For me the biggest plus is that a top-zip bag is so much easier to access than flap-over briefs and messengers. That, however, leads me to my one major concern: will the zippers hold up? They feel flimsy, and I wish Ben S. had hiked the price by $10 and channeled that money into better hardware.  But I may be pleasantly surprised, and at this price point it's well worth taking a chance that they will last.",Best deal in town

There is a large zippered inside pocket as well as two smaller pockets.  What I don't like is the graphics are upside down!!  I'm really disappointed in that.

These would make a very nice Valentine's Day gift- hearts and jewelry! Also, one of my favorite things about Amazon Collection jewelry is the gift box it comes in.

4,"UPDATE:  I won't change my previous rating of 4 stars, but after wearing these several times I've discovered that they are stretching out too much to be comfortable within a couple hours of wear. I have just gone in and ordered a smaller size. I suggest you size down.

Original post:  As usual, this is another great pair of democracy jeans. These I would say have more stretch to them than others that I have bought. With democracy, I can either be a size 22 or size 20, depending on the cut of the jeans. Due to the stretch, I'm glad I bought the 20's. (NOTE: with this pair, I went back later to get a size 18 due to the amount of stretch. ).

One thing that I would like to mention is that they come cuffed, but the cuffs are not sewn in. So, you can uncuff them if you like, or, you can make the cuffs wider if you want to. Also, something else unique about the jeans is the color of the button and rivets. They are kind of a coppery pink color. Really different, and I really like it.",Very stretchy. Size down!

4,"The majority of reviews nailed the critique of this coat straight on. I used the coat in temps between 4 and 22 degrees F. It keeps you plenty warm even with just a sweater under it. The coat is comfortable, but should be ordered in a size larger than you normally need, if you plan to wear a lot of layers under it for lengthy exposure time in harsh weather.

The two complaints you hear over and over again is the zipper sucks....IT DOES!!!  And the hood... its held on by 3 snaps so it is fairly useless in wind. It really makes you wonder how they could make such a great coat, but totally overlook 2 fairly simple design flaws. The undersized zipper is difficult to initially zipper given the bulk of the coat. In addition on several occasions the zipper separated at the bottom, though went back together fairly easy.
For me in Churchill Canada the hood will be useless due to high winds, which is too bad since it looks pretty nice.  Even the most BASIC ski jacket I have ever owned had a better way designed to attach the hood.  I will probably keep the coat due to the warmth provided vs cost. However I am fairly certain I will be cursing the design team under my breath, each time I wear it.  I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars...but you don't have that option.",So close.....but what were the designers thinking?

4,"This is a great Fall, early winter coat!  It's very stylish and comfy.  I noted that the sizing runs small as with most Diesel apparel.  I am 6' 174lbs and I bought and XXL and it fits very well.  You will need to buy at least one size up if not two.  I would recommend two so you can wear things comfortably underneath.  I got an amazing deal on this jacket so I could not pass it up.  I might be wrong to only give it 4 stars but the reason I did was it was made in China.  I love Diesel things, however, it makes me nervous when they are made in China.  The quality and longevity is almost never the same.  Maybe they have started outsourcing things to China factories, however, I know in the past that's where the knock offs came from and was usually a tell tale clue.  I was assured on this, however, that it was authentic, and seems to pass all other tests, tags etc.  The Second reason for four stars is, even though the jacket is great, the normal price is completely outrageous.  In all reality this is not a jacket, moreover a glorified sweater.  Like I said, I got an amazing deal, so I'm not complaining, and like I said it's comfortable, warm, and attractive so I'm happy with the purchase.","This is a great Fall, early winter coat"

4,"I haven't really worn these outside as yet, so consider this an unboxing more than a comfort or durability report.
For decades I've enjoyed Sperry Makos. Durable, attractive, and for me they have better soles than regular boat shoes, because they aren't as thin as those. Makes a difference when not walking on a smooth deck for sure! Tough and versatile and comfortable enough to take on a long trip, walk all over Paris in the day and wear with casual night wear too.
Unfortunately, for some very odd reason Sperry was out of my size until Fall (?????) and they keep changing the color range. They had already eliminated the colors I like, then didn't even stock the item. So I had to look elsewhere.
Trying these Sebagos (which DO come in a wide color range including those I like), I found them different, but they appear workable. They seem to be well made. The soles - a key point for me - appear to be between the Sperry too thin originals and the Mako thick ones. I think that part will work out. They do appear to have a lower yoke in front, so my foot slips forward more into the tongue. I do not know why others found them narrower than posted size; I found them to be on target, which at the D(M) size is actually a bit wide for my foot.
If my view of them changes once having worn them for a while, I'll post that.",Interesting alternative to the ubiquitous Sperry shoes

4,"My son really likes this watch. My only concern is that he's only had it a couple weeks and he said today a pin fell out near the clasp. Luckily he figured out how to put it back together. Hopefully it was just a fluke and it'll be ok.

UPDATE! The pin fell out again & this time my son couldn't find it. I immediately logged onto Amazon & requested to exchange the item. I quickly received a replacement watch, which was identical to the original item purchased. I didn't have to leave my house to return the defective item either, which was absolutely wonderful and convenient for this busy mom. My son wears the watch daily and has not had any problems with it since he received the new one. He's had the new watch a couple weeks now, if not longer.

So the sizing is on par with how they make their shoes, they just tend to make them big. I normally wear a 12, 11 for these worked. Also, if you're like me, there a chance that they'll be worn sans socks.  So that's another thing to consider when ordering.
I really like how they look with shorts.  I want to wear them with jeans, but I don't think any of my jeans look casual enough.
Also, as others have stated, the sole is thin. I have Sanuks with much better soles so it's not impossible for a cheap slip on. That being said, you may want to purchase insoles if you plan on wearing these all day. All in all, for the price, this was a great buy.",Great casual tennis shoe

4,"I like this product, but it was WAY too big! I normally wear XL tops, so I usually get a size bigger for jackets/sweaters. After looking at the sizing, I decided to go with a 2X, which turned out to be massive. I am returning the item and purchasing the same in the regular L size, (as opposed to ""Plus"" size). It was very soft and the sleeves were plenty long which is why I'm re-ordering the item.","Way too big, but very soft and comfy!"
4,It's a nice backpack medium size so you can put lots of stuff on it.  Good quality.  I love the color my picture went so bright but it is like a mustard yellow not bright yellow.

4,The slip is a little short and sheerish and the neckline is much higher and tighter than shown. I still like it though. I wear a black cotton pencil skirt or shorts under and it looks very nice. If you lengthened the straps you could achieve the look shown. (For ref i'm 5'7 135-140lbs 34C/D),I still like it though
4,"I ordered the jacket a size larger than normal after reading the reviews.  It's large in the shoulders, but I still can't button it.  It's nice and heavy with copper buttons and side pockets.  The price was great.",Still too small
4,"Really liked this one. I tried it without the straps and it wouldn't stay up on me, also looked incomplete... The top border of mine was a slightly different color/fabric design than the rest of the suit and the way it was pointed up where the straps go (imagine a regular suit that you cut the straps off but didn't make it go straight across the bust line, you left sort of triangle looking bust tops) that's what it looked like. I suspect the model here is ""holding in"" in the tops of the suit to make it look like it goes straight across, you can kind of see it pulled straight and tucked under her armpit...

With the straps though it was super cute. Hides the bulges on the beach but is still really flattering. I was hoping for a strapless suit which is why I only gave this 4 stars, but if I had to rate this as a regular suit, I'd give it 5 stars.

Overall fit was good. I ordered a size up which I always have to do in bathing suits and this one was great!

Washes well, doesn't stick to you and get all funny looking coming out of the water. Dries REALLY fast, which is HUGE! The inside bra padding does come out which is amazing - wish all designers had this. If you're order a plus size bathing suit, chances are you don't need any help in the ""girls"" department... my opinion, my body-type I guess :)",Really liked this one

4,"I actually really like this bag. I was concerned about it not being real leather, but this is actually a pretty high quality fake. The inside looks and feels like unfinished leather, and the outside doesn't feel plasticky or fake. It is also a thicker, more structured bag than some of the real ones out there, like madewell a transport tote-- it holds its shape and stands up on its own. I like the option of the organizer, though I use it without because the bag is roomier that way and looks a little more high-end. It is a really, really pretty bag, and it is huge-- I use it a a diaper bag and I could fit a picnic blanket in there too if I wanted. The only reason I took away a star is the bag is hard to clean. My daughter emptied an entire bottle of milk in it, and the organizer didn't hold it-- it went right through. We cleaned it up with saddle soap, so it doesn't smell anymore, but I couldn't buff the stain out because the interior isn't real leather, and it flakes a little with scrubbing. So, I would make sure all bottles are leak proof or put them in a ziplock bag. The exterior cleans easily, since it is sealed--just wipe off!",I actually really like this bag

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the ankle strap at top sits a little funny for me - it's not snug and gaps a little on the left and right of my ankle, but a little gap may be a good thing while walking, probably better than having it completely snug around your ankle.",Super cute and the soft material makes it very comfortable ...

4,"This expandable 4 wheeler has arrived just in time. I'm going away for three days and wanted to take a compact carry on with me to dodge an additional  baggage fee and criss/cross the terminal I use at the airport.
It's an attractive case with a durable exterior and solid zippers. It has four wheels which provides for greater stability as well as maneuverability. The recessed handle is well constructed and solid. It did not stick. It is extremely light yet solidly.
My usual set of suitcases is DELSEY. They are very nice and near identical to this Tumi Alpha except they do not have four wheels. They are not spinners yet the smallest suitcase compares well to this one in terms of general capacity and overall weight.

4,"I love all things cat! I'm 5'9"" and 130 lbs, and I find the fit to be acceptable. The sleeves don't reach my wrists, and the sweater falls just at the small of my back. Be forewarned that the sweater material is scratchy, but if you wear a tank top under it you'll be fine. This sweater washes fine in cold water on delicate, and then I hang on a hanger to dry in order to let gravity assist in maintaining the sweater's length :)

Overall, if you'll looking for a big, baggy fit, you won't find it here unless you're really petite. That being said, the cat design is fun and oddly sophisticated in an artistic way. Definitely not long enough to wear as a tunic, but it's a great statement piece for a cat-lover's wardrobe!",I love all things cat

4,"Comfortable shoes with great support (does not aggravate my plantar fasciitis).  Good looking shoe.  Only gave 4 stars due to the light gray dye not being thick enough on one side of one shoe, allowing the black under-layer to show through.  Given the difference between the regular price of this shoe and the closeout price I paid, I can live with the slight defect.
Another commentor stated they were a mottled gray and white but this is not true.  They are a very light gray (almost white) with something like a cracked glitter spray finish.  Due to the angling of the cracked glitter, it catches light different, which sometimes can look like some faint mottling. Back if one moves the shoe around, one can see that the color is actually uniform, and any difference in coloring is due to the way light plays on the finish.
I wear a size 6.5 and this size 6.5 fits fine.  Also, I usually have a problem with the bunion on the great toe getting squeezed but there is ample room in the toe box of this shoe.",Comfortable shoes with great support (does not aggravate my plantar ...

4,"Cute, but the fake tie between the cups is very wonky. The ends are too long to just tie into a knot without long floppy ends, and too short to tie into a bow.

No instructions provided to adjust band and must be requested from Casio.  Provided only after you sign a from releasing them from any liability.  Band is difficult to adjust.  Detents in stem position (to select setting function) are very close together and hard to distinguish.  I'd still recommend it, just be forewarned.",Nice watch with annoyances

They require a little break in as the pad surrounding the heal is a bit stiff, but overall pretty comfy. The buckle can border on pilgrim like - at least it's not in the middle of the shoe! I can't say I love the shoes 10 out of 10, more like a 9. But they were on sale and great for walking around the city.",I like how Miz Mooz shoes are still somewhat feminine

I like it because I can continue to wear it after I'm done with nursing my son and pumping and it will still be stylish.  Not all moms will probably be able to wear this immediately following pregnancy depending on their belly.  I do sometimes wear a support garment under it (waist cincher).

4,"The color is rich and the pattern within gives it an interesting depth without being garish.  It is somewhere between a fall and winter jacket.  It is true to size for a 1x, but I think it is on the smaller-side for Columbia as their clothing tends to run large.  It is also a wee bit shorter than I was expecting.  It would be nice if there was some shaping in the waist.","Warm, nice color, a touch short"

I, personally think that although it is really pretty, it would be even nicer if it was a bit longer. That is just my own preference though. I'm sure that she is going to be happy with it.

4,I'm a very small framed woman. Dress size 0-2 pants 00-0 5'6 106 lbs it's big on me.. Idk how to feel about it yet . I bought these shirts for work. I work a warehouse type job and sweat more than usual under my arms due to hyperhydrosis. I'm more worried about the moisture control than the fit. I got the xs which is the smallest size available . I've read other reviews about head clothes running large and I was right to order the xs. Either way I'm keeping it. The keyhole in back is also cute..,"Cute, but big"

I had them on for like 20 minutes for a fitting, and when I took them off, I had to slowly reintroduce my foot to flat ground. I just wish the heel was about an inch shorter . I don't want to say I settled for this shoe but I seriously looked everywhere and could not find a design I loved this much that had a heel how I wanted it. So here it is. They may not last much past the ceremony though.","Love the design, need a more practical heel"
4,Excellent price and they look amazing. Im not a fan of suede on shoes but this one rocks it very adequately. One thing I would warn about and the reason I gave this 4 stars is that you do not want to get these wet. I found that the more they got wet the more the black in some areas seemed to fade.

4,"This fit extremely well and I wasn't really expecting it to be a high-waist jean I just recently bought a crop top for these jeans and I absolutely adore it. The only dislike I may have is that it doesn't really mask stomachs well so there's these awkward bumps of sorts in the front but due to the color its not really noticeable at least I think.

4,Decent pair of shoes and ad-advertised in terms of look (a little more textured in person perhaps). Biggest downside is that they get dirty easily (especially at the toes if you drag your foot at all). I didn't seal them which is my fault and now there is a semi-permanent dark discoloration at the underside of the toe. Not particularly noticeable but if it gets worse it will be.,Looks and feels as pictured and imagined.

4,"Excellent quality, but the main downside is the size. It is large enough to fit a 15"" laptop if it is put in vertically and can fit some other small items, but capacity is pretty limited. I wouldn't use this for backpacking, as it won't hold a lot of stuff, but its good for commuting. Another downside is the lack of padding on the bottom of the bag, which means laptops will only have the canvas as shielding. Be very gentle when handling it, as if you smack something or drop the bag your laptop might get damaged. Good pockets, solid design and build and the option to choose backpack versus messenger bags (or leave both on like I do!) is very convenient for different load situations. Dirt doesn't really show on this bag, its tough and long lasting.

4,"Very good luggage if you frequently fly around Europe on the low cost carriers such as Ryan Air, Easy Jet, etc, and are great at packing very light. Or, if you're taking different airlines to travel to multiple destinations (I'm flying on Norwegian Air, SAS, Aer Lingus, Meridiana)... they all have slightly differing dimensions/weight limits for carry on bags, and the size of this bag can be customized by using the ingenious zipper system. But -- I decided to return the bag, I needed something sturdier, especially on bottom, will be carrying around some mosaics around Italy. And also you lose a bit of packing space because the expandable areas are not the full depth. For $50 price, I was able to buy lots of travel gear like a cable lock, a Travelon anti-theft shoulder bag, compression packing bags, among other things... and borrow a much stronger softshell suitcase with better wheels and bottom stand (so it doesn't tip over), which was able to work with the varying size weight requirements. While I'm in Europe, I will be looking around at similar options to but more cheaply and bring back to US.","Good for Ryan Air, Easy Jet, other low cost European carriers... and you know how to pack light"

The design looks great, and is just like the listing pic; it looks exactly as I expected it to look.
As far as physical quality - how it feels - it depends how picky you are. It's not the softest shirt, and it's not thick at all. It doesn't have a very high thread count. But for me, it's good. It fits, it's not falling apart, it's not stiff, and it's not scratchy. That's good in my book.

4,"Good shoe - I was a little nervous when I first opened the box as the build quality seemed to be sub-par; some of the seams (particularly where the sole of the shoe is attached) looked shoddy - thus far though (about a month of daily commuting to work on foot) they are holding together nicely with no issues and have proven to be surprisingly water resistant, which I also wasn't too sure about when I first wore them and felt the amount of air flow they had.

Overall a good shoe, I'll update If I notice any untimely wear on the shoes.","Good shoe, reasonably water-proof"

4,"I'll start off by saying that I really like this skirt. At 5 foot 3, it was the perfect length--not too short, not too long. However, the fit is a little strange. I was right between a 3 and 5. Normally I would have gone with the 5 but they were sold out so I took a gamble and went with the 3. The waist was actually on the large side and the hips were a bit snug--not a problem I usually have since my figure is pretty straight. I stretched the skirt out and it fits well now.","Length good, fit a little strange"
4,"This  Kezzi watch looks more expensive than it is, with its leather band, sleek profile, and large face with copper-colored (or rose-gold-colored, if you will) frame/case.  The face is extremely easy to read, both because of its size and because of the contrast between black numbers/hands and cream--colored background.

The watch itself says nothing about water-resistance, and while the product page states that it is water resistant to 99 feet, it  says in the same sentence that it's not for ""showering or submersion.""  In other words, it's water resistant only if you splash it by accident.  To me, this is the only failing of this otherwise perfect-for-every-day watch.  I don't need to go swimming with it, but I also want to be confident that it would be safe if I forgot to remove it.  Of course, the current retail price reflects that limitation, so I docked the watch only a half-star.

This is an elegant yet inexpensive watch that would make a nice accessory or gift for a women or teenage girl.  If you don't care about water resistance, consider this a five-star product within its price point.  Note:  I received a sample for review.

4,"Id like to start out by stating that this is a very pretty mask. The parcel did come from China and took some time to get here, so don't order this if you need it super fast. It took about 2 weeks for me to get it in, which in all honesty is pretty good for it coming from China. That being said, the quality of this mask isn't quite what I was hoping for and some of which is directly related to how it was shipped. When the mask arrived, the flower on the side of the front was badly squished. This is to be somewhat expected considering that it needed to be shipped from the other side of the world in a small parcel package; however, I am so far unable to fluff the flower up enough as of yet to make the flower look any less squished. Also, the position of the flower almost totally obstructs vision from the eyehole on the right side of the mask. I tried to open the vision back up from fluffing the flower, but as state before, I was not very successful in achieving my mission in making the flower less squished which also caused for right eye vision obstruction. The mask is also quite glittery so the glitter does fall off around the mask and makes a bit of a mess, but that is forgivable to me knowing the nature and messiness of glitter. It might be possible to repair the flower better after hitting it with a hot blow dryer to heat it up so that it is easier to manipulate; however, I have not tried this as of yet.

The pair I purchased arrived attached to a thick piece of display-case cardboard, the sort of thing you'd see hanging on a rack atop a department store counter. That's fine, of course, if you're purchasing these cuff links for personal use, but I intended them as a gift. I expect cuff links to, at least, be packaged in a small cardboard box, just as every other set of cufflinks I've purchased prior to this have been packaged. Not this time.

4,Nice fit and comfortable ... the nose of the shoe is a bit longer than most ... but still happy,Nice shoes
4,The bracelet is very nice looking and comfortable to wear. The edges could stand to be softer finished ie. rounded and the corners blunted some. Bling Jewelry should upgrade the shipping method as tracking is not customer friendly. After the package had been stalled for a week I called Bling and after talking with them and explaining I had worked for a major catalog company I know how to track a package and this was lost in transit. They shipped a replacement and both showed up a few days later.,Good buy

4,"I wear an 8.5 W or a 9 in most shoes or boots and ordered the size 39 based on other reviews that they ran large.  These are super lightweight and very comfortable but the 39 was too tight on my foot due to the thick insole.  I reordered the size 40 in this shoe and a different Sanita shoe and they both fit perfectly even with the thick insole. I would suggest ordering the larger size unless you have a very thin narrow and bony foot. Even in the size 40, I could not wear socks with these unless I removed the insole ( yes, the insole IS removable).

The leather is very soft, no breaking in needed though I never wear new shoes for long jaunts.  They do have arch support. The velcro strap is very adjustable and great for those of us whose feel swell during the day :D

I got the blue which is a very neutral blue just like in the photo.  I paid around 40 dollars for these and may order another pair in a different color if they go on sale.",Wonderful shoe for the great Sale price

4,"I like this, but it is quite large. I'm overweight and is still large. I bought to wear to the beach, but I think of it more as a night gown. I'm an 18/22 size, so it will fit most. I guess it depends on how large you feel comfortable in when going out. But, it works around the house. Please take their washing instructions seriously, as it does bleed the first wash or two.

I dropped one star simply because I like a little tighter knit weave. But, all in all, it's still warm. I'm going to measure it, and knit some myself.

4,"I bought this as a gift for my mother but since we are somewhat similar in size I tried it on to make sure it would fit her.  We are both pretty short (5'2"") so it hits at ankle length, for a regular size person it would probably be below the knee.  I got my mom a large due to other reviews talking about size of arms.  The arms are pretty narrow, I'm about 120 and they weren't tight but they weren't loose at all, so if you have bigger arms this is not the sweater for you.  I really like the slits up the side, they come up pretty far, cute detail and the hood is nice to have as well.  Also, as others have stated, it is not a thick sweater but since this is what I was looking for I wasn't bothered by that at all, and it's not so thin as to be pointless.  Overall I really like it and may be ordering one for myself if they get the black back in stock, I got navy for my mom, and I think she will too.",Bought as a Gift

4,"This came in perfect condition - no stitching mistakes or anything crooked looking. It is mid-profile and structured which is exactly what baseball players used to wear and why I wanted it. Great quality. I don't care much for the back closure of a buckle and loop, but if you can't see it then it doesn't matter much. It does fit deep in the front and shallow in the back. You won't have a high forehead - it isn't that structured - but it may not fit as snug on the back of your head as it does in front. One other side note.

It gives you an air of authority wanted or not, if you choose black or navy. I've had remarks that it was intimidating to a child and made me look like law enforcement according to someone else. If you want to really keep the sun out of your face or keep a low profile with a mid profile hat that doesn't look like those cheap foam trucker hats or floppy caps everyone wears, this is the hat for you. Just don't be surprised if you get suspected of looking like a criminal or of being just the opposite. I recommend this and will probably buy another although I wish they had gray.",Vintage Baseball Style
4,"When I opened these, I wasn't sure they were going to fit, as I wear anywhere from a size 10 to 14 in pants, but they fit just fine. They are shiny, and the black does get lighter where they stretch, but I bought them to wear around the house so they're just fine.","Fits nice, I love Jack!"

4,Uber comfy!!!!,Love
4,"Upon opening, I was not very impressed. It was bought with the intention of giving to my mother for Mother's Day or her birthday. It is not suitable for either. It's entirely plastic, like a Barbie toy. But after putting the batteries in, placing the ballerina on top, and turning it on....it definitely has it's charm. I still wouldn't give it to an adult, but I could see buying it for a young daughter and her being mesmerized by it. The piano keys and foot pedals move with the music as if they are actually being played, as the ballerina spins and twirls on top. It's a pretty neat effect. The quality of the electronic music box isn't the greatest, but the six songs it plays are pretty classical pieces. (It plays them in order, in a loop, so you have to wait a while to hear it circle back to the beginning. It takes 4 AA batteries and there is no winding (the description said there was both).
*UPDATE *
I decided to go ahead and give it to my mother for her birthday, and once it started playing, she instantly burst into tears and began telling stories of how this piece reminded her of her childhood. She loved it. Not sure if you'll have the same result, but who knows? ...","Cute, for a child, or a reminiscent adult..."

4,"This dress has NO back! or sides! I would post a picture, but it's borderline indecent. Normally this doesn't really bother me, but as I bought it for a school function and from the back it looked like I was wearing a (TINY) swimsuit, it had to go back. Here are my thoughts: I have no waist or hips, so the dress kinda slipped lower and lower until it was just barely over my booty 'cleft'. That girl in the back view photo- she's probably holding the dress up to keep it from sliding off her booty. Maybe I needed a smaller size? If you've got some lovely lady lumps, this dress could rock someone's world - if you're brave.  Also, the side has snaps...which means whatever you wear under will show..so you'll have to wear some kind of super low-cut, nice looking undergarment. Oh, and forget about a bra.

4,"Cute boots. Thick leather, but zipper tough to slide up and down (perhaps some paraffin wax would solve that). Calf width is quite large if worn against my skin. My calves measure about 14.5"" in diameter. These have room for skinny jeans, etc to slide inside the boot. But I am 5'5"" and my legs are a bit on the short side and my biggest issue with the boots is they are too tall and hit the bottom edge of my knee caps. So I must return them.","Cute boots. Thick leather, but zipper tough to ..."
4,"I was impressed that the accessories are so high-quality, but there's one problem: The horns are not on a headband; they are clip-on barrettes, and if you wear your hair down, they don't stay in place. Caveat emptor! But like I said, they're so nice that I may make my own headband and glue the horns on.",But like I said
4,"The dress is ADORABLE.  Unfortunately, I am 5'2 and the dress is way to long. I bought a size 8 and it is about 37 inches long starting at the shoulder. It came inches past my knees.  It feels like it is made well. The zipper worked well and I did not feel like the bust was too small. The dress wasn't TOO flared but just right.  I don't think it can even be tailored shorter because it would go into the blue stripes.  If your tall go for it!",Nice Dress
4,"Fantastic boot, especially for the price.  Rugged, simple, quality leather.  Although it did fit tiny bit larger than I thought it would (given that all of my other shoes the same size fit perfectly on me), I still gave it a ""Fit as expected"" rating because it was only slightly larger, and, I have a somewhat thinner foot.",Great Boot for the Price
4,These shoes are really cute and they are comfortable once I got them on. The problem was the straps. There is no stretch in the straps at all so I had a very hard time sliding them on my feet. Once I got them in they were comfortable,cute shoes but....
4,"I like these step-ins, though you really can't just step into them. The opening is quite small, and my ankles are thick front-to-back, so that when I got them on, they were pinching me. That said, I was looking for inexpensive but durable low galoshes to use just for quick trips outside with my dog. I cut a big ""U"" out of the front of the opening, which did not compromise the integrity of the material at all (very sturdy), so that I can now slip them on and off easily and be comfortable in them. I like the loose fit. The tread is nice, too, because the design lets water shed away without picking up a lot of debris. So, after my surgical modification, I'm very pleased with the shoes, and the price was certainly right. 4-star only because of the small opening.",Just what I was looking for.

4,"They're beautiful, particularly for the price. They did run a little big, which surprised me, as they're heels and I expect them to fit a little snugly if anything. The brooch you see in the side of the shoe is actually a velcro connector for the three straps there, which is maybe why it can't be too snug (because it might disconnect easily)but since I bought them to wear in a wedding, we will see how they fair! Also the heel was a lot higher than the picture let on, not sure whose fault that is (if anyone's), but even looking at this picture I still feel like it doesn't adequately display how high the heel is. Also, the width was snug, but I think that's because I tend to have a wide width, so it sort of JUST works for me. Just things to consider if you're looking at these shoes!","Beautiful for the Price, might run a little large"

4,"I really like this set.  The 1 quart carrying pouch is nice, and the bottles don't take up much room (especially after you've used the contents).  I had liquid in the bottles and they didn't leak at all during our airline trip.  I'm very happy with their performance!

There was one issue though that I docked a star for, and that was in regards to how much I could actually fit in the bottles.  The 1 oz bottle held 1 liquid oz.  Great!  The 2 oz bottle held a bit more than 1.5 oz.  Hmm, okay.  The 3 oz bottle held only 2 oz.  That's not great.  I tried flexing the bottles to see if that would help it hold more, but it didn't.  This was a bummer.

If you're using these for liquid, they're easy to rinse out and use again.  Creamy-type toiletries like a heavy-duty moisturizer or hair styling products will be harder to clean out perfectly, but in my case I just stick a piece of freezer tape to the bottle with the name of whatever was in it, and before the next trip I make sure that's what goes in that bottle again.

Anyway, it's a very nice set, I just wish the 3 oz bottle held 3 oz.","Nice set, though the 3 oz bottle only holds 2 oz"

Sleeves just right, waist length a bit on the short side, but will work fine, as we bought a bit large so she can grow into it.

4,I love costume jewelry and wear it often because you can make the colors in your clothes stand out more than when you wear just your diamond studs for instance.  The purple stones in these earrings are very bright and attractive and I chose to wear these with a long white tank and a lighter purple blazer.  I paired that with dark jeggings and dark plum boots.  The whole look was really cute and I think the earrings helped tie it all together.  They are a unique design and the entire Amazon Collection of costume jewelry is really very edgy and original.  Recommended.,Cool loop design
4,These Gino Valentino leather dress shoes weren't too bad!  The fit perfectly and seem very stylish. The quality of the show is just as good as a pair of bass shoes for the price or maybe even better. I'd say they look and feel very European.  I'm happy with this purchase a lot.

I actually pulled down on each end to bend it and now it both feels and looks a lot more normal.

4,"Product: I chose the blue bag. The color is as I expected it to be, the color you see in the picture is pretty close. The bag is a bit small. I put in a thin notebook, an ipad, a 7""x10"" notebook, and my wallet. It's full. If I take out the thin notebook, then everything fits nicely. However, I need the notebook for school, so that disappoints me a bit. The small pocket in the front is only big enough to fit my iphone and my keys. I don't think I'll be utilizing the inside or outside zipper pockets. I will not be able to fit anything on the inside pocket. As for the outside pocket, I don't want the object to poke at my back when I am wearing it as a backpack.

Commentary/Suggestion: Overall, it's an okay bag. I will have to use it for a day or two to get a really good feel for it. I would recommend making the bag a tad bigger. Some people (like me) really like big bags or slightly bigger than this. Plus, I bought this bag because I like the way I can switch between a shoulder bag and a backpack. Like I said, I just wished it was a tad bigger.

I will most likely write an update later on.",Blue Unisex Travel Backpack

4,"This boot is great.  A few weeks ago, one of the buckles broke off, but I glued it back and its barely noticeable.  I noticed that the heal is starting to come off, but I just make sure to be careful of them and may have to do a little repair in a few month.  I will say that these are 10x better than a pair of $80 boots I got a few years ago.  The grip on the bottom is really good and they are pretty warm.",This boot is great. A few weeks ago

4,"These are my 3rd pair of Serengetis, but only 2nd in recent years.  They are medium width.  I have a large head and fairly wide spaced eyes but my brow is narrower so they just about fit.  Unlike another model of Serengeti I recently had, which were just too cheaply made, these feel better built and when you fold them the arms don't end up scratching the lenses (so far).  Lenses aren't as scratch resistant as my old glass Maui Jims (which are built like tanks compared to these), but they seem like they'll last awhile.  The photochromic thing works and they change fast.  But I wish they went a little lighter and probably a little darker as well.  The color is a fairly strong yellowish amber.  I like that but you might not, so get a different color of them.","Nice, light shades"
4,"I ordered the shoes in my normal size 8M because reputable websites indicated that they were a normal fit but they were too narrow at the widest part of my foot. I could walk in them for short distances and it was not noticeable that my foot overhung the side of the shoe. However, I really wish they fit correctly as they were my wedding shoes and I had no time to return them and order the correct shoes. It was also very inconvenient to have to change out of them whenever I had to walk anything more than a short distance. Beautiful shoe other than that so I strongly recommend that you order a wide fit if you normally wear a medium fitting shoe.",Narrower than normal
4,"Good everyday shoes, but not quite as comfortable as the previous versions of the same shoe I've had which were lighter, made of softer leather and had a Gortex water repellant liner.

It's just one thin fabric all over.  I was looking for a light-weight jacket since San Francisco weather is mainly sunny so I didn't want to end up carrying a heavy jacket all over the place, so I wanted a lightweight jacket, BUT I wanted a jacket that was warm enough if I was outside in the night time when it turns really cold, but it doesn't look like I'll be able to use it in the night time, only the day time.  Basically if it's a cold day or it's the night time, this jacket will NOT keep you warm.

My issue with this shoe is that the rim around the opening for your foot is made of such hard plastic that I didn't think I would be able to get my foot in the first time.

If you need thick wool socks for working outdoors or around the house, these are an inexpensive version that seems well made. They don't hold their shape really well in the washer/dryer, but that's to be expected I think. They're a simple weave pattern--no complex arch support and such like some other brands. They're quite low in cost, though, for wool socks. It's a trade-off. If you need well-formed socks or thinner ones, you're going to pay more.",Very thick & warm; great for the price
4,"I love the watch; the blue crystal is elegant and it is easy to read. It's a man's watch but I bought it for myself (I'm a woman) because it was elegant, lightweight and simple. The band is lovely too. The only problem is the CLASP--watch out! The first day I wore it, the clasp came undone 14 times within 3 hours. I took it off and decided not to wear it until I could have a jeweler look at it.  Fortunately a small adjustment was made so that the clasp stayed closed and it has been fine (so far). However, the jeweler said if the problem returns, I may have to change the entire band (not happy about that). But for now it's great. To summarize: watch excellent, band comfortable, clasp is crap.","Good watch, bad clasp."

4,"My old wallet was 26mm full. I have 16 cards and a little cash in there.  My last wallet was a money clip type, made of leather, and already very thin designed.  It had two externally accessible pockets and a clip inside.  It was easy to get stuff into but getting a card, normally meant pulling out several and then sorting through them for the right one.  I used it for 13 years so it was quite stretched out and cards were falling out if I wasn't careful.  I boiled and reshaped it to get more life out of it, but it was time to buy a new one.

Pros:
The aluminium is very good quality, as is the finish
The o-rings do seem strong.  I was concerned with them breaking
The A4 is very thin.
The O-Rings add a bit of thickness to it but they also add grip so it doesn't fall out of my pocket.
The O-Rings hold everything secure

Cons:
Cash carry is kind of inconvenient.  You need to fold in thirds to fit in, but quarter folds works better.
Since it is more of a floating design, the OCD side of me wants to constantly try to align the layers :)
No attachment points to secure it in rougher environments.

So now, I'm sure everyone wants to know how thick it is in comparison to the old one... 24mm, including the O-Rings.
I saved 2mm.  Weight was about the same.  Loading the walled it easy, except the triangle side.  It does better with fewer items in it than the rectangle one.  Getting stuff out is pretty easy.  The O-Rings hold secure but when you stretch them to get inside, the cards lightly fan and make it easier to pull out just one.  I wish it had a hole in it for a carabiner, but that is my only wish.  It would be helpful when climbing, hiking, or doing other things that put wallet loss at risk. I may drill a small hole myself.  Other than that, I am satisfied with it.  It functions well and is thinner than any other I have had or researched.  I'm adding pictures for size reference and so you can see mine in actual use configuration.",A4 is great for 16 cards and cash.

4,"Love the look. Definitely waterproof too - I used them snowshoeing and they stood up pretty well. However, just as other reviewers have said, there's no zipper so they're not the easiest to remove. My method is to use my left foot to step on the right, in order to remove that boot first, then use my hands to remove the left one. Yes, it's a pain to do, and the first time I wore them I needed help just to get them off. That said, I still really like them and have worn them for a good chunk of the winter. The white fur is a nice touch especially over dark pants or leggings. Also, I find that the laces open very easily and I have to re-tie them often. The soles are solid, and they are very comfortable for wearing for long periods of time.",Love the look

They are on the larger side of True to Size, but NOT a full size large.  I am happy with the purchase.  That said, I only gave this 4 stars because the inner leg seam is not flat.

4,"This is my second pair of Sorel boots for my daughter, we have bought Kamik twice before as well.  I feel like for Wisconsin weather you need boots that have good insulation and keep your feet dry and warm.  Both these brands do this if you carefully look at the description of the styles and make sure they go down to low temps.  Easy for kids to step in and out of and tighten themselves.  Have never had a leaking problem, nor any issues with wear and tear the look brand new after two years of use (I guess I buy a little big and get two years out of them).  My daughter got mud all over them and  they rinsed off with water easily even on the fabric upper part and they air-dried in time for the next day just fine.  I switched to Sorel as I think the toe area is less narrow and my daughter has a wider foot towards the toe.",solid boot
4,"These leggings were of a great style and color. The fit is as expected by a little short in length, if you like a longer legging go up a size. The sheerness is evident so these leggings must be worn with a longer top. A great rockers edge to the style great to wear with booties and a long sweater and top or even under a skirt.

I believe if I had purchased the ""medium"" size it would have probably been a little on the tight side.

The ""shorts"" can be rolled from longer shorts to slightly shorter shorts. They wash well. They do make a slight crinkling sound as you wear them, which maybe is only noticeable to a new mom with a very cranky newborn.",I really liked these when I first got them

We have run around the park and gone in and out of the baby swing without these suckers falling off. My son can kick them off if he wants to but with distraction he forgets all about them. He has been on an anti-shoe kick so I was tired of fighting to put on tennis shoes which involved socks and I also had boots with fur inside so no need to socks but those were so clunky I could understand by my son didn't want to wear them. I got these for to and from daycare and since I got them they have become the only shoes I use. Not sure what I will do when it gets warmer out since these do appear to warm his feet a lot.

However, the belt fabric is super slippery ... and this means there's no way to keep the belt at your size. It is always slipping around the adjustment brackets -- you have to re-tighten it several times a day. There is probably a solution for this, but I haven't thought of it yet.

These blues are holding together quite nicely as my everydays and I'm very satisfied.  It should be noted that I purchased here on Amazon for $36 during a shoe sale so at their current pricing I honestly can't say one way or the other if I would have made the purchase.  I'm not so much cheap per se but I generally seek value rather than retail pricing.
One more significant note:  These have in white print ""Kenneth Cole / Reaction"" on the back. I wish they didn't. Kenneth Cole would have done better to keep these shoes more minimal and slick. But for the price I paid that little issue is a non issue.

4,"My husband likes to wear necklaces (masculine ones). This necklace is perfect for him and exactly his style. If I had to chose a store that he shops at most it would be Guess. I've seen similar necklaces in there, in fact he has a necklace thats a similar design, but he likes this one better now. It has a masculine ram look to it, in fact it reminds me of the Dodge Ram logo, but his one looks much tougher. Here are some points about it:

 ~Heavy: This is a solid feeling necklace. It is pure metal, no hollow areas. When I first picked it up I could feel that its not a cheap, low quality piece of jewelry. It weighs 19 grams on the kitchen scale. His favorite Guess cross necklace weighs 21 grams for comparison.
 ~Chain: The chain is nice and sturdy. I like the particular type of clasp on it. I gave it a few good tugs and it didn't break. It is a masculine looking chain because it actually has like chain links. My husband likes it a lot. The only thing to note about it is theres no size adjuster. Make sure you like the length of this before ordering. I am attaching a picture of my husband wearing it so you can see where it falls. He's an average sized guy for comparison.
 ~Metal: The metal itself is close to flawless. It is a shiny, nice looking silver. The quality is great.
 ~Paint: When looking at from a normal distance it looks great. Since Im being a little more critical because Im writing a review I notice that the black pain isn't done perfectly. This isn't a dramatic enough thing that I would notice it right off the bat, it took me a few minutes of inspecting to nice it. But since Im sitting here turning it over and examining every crack, I can tell. On the bottom arrow part in the picture it is painted black with a tiny border of unpainted silver around it. On ours the black paint isn't painted quite as carefully. The silver edge isn't a straight, uniform line. I'm docking one star for this.

This is a great necklace for the price. Usually every year I buy my husband a necklace like this from Guess and spend around $20-$40 for something similar. This is definitely as good of quality as that for a much better price.",Good quality masculine looking necklace.

4,"Color is a bit more olive than what is pictured (lighter green). This is why I am giving it 4 stars. I was hoping for a dark/army green like pictured. But it really isn't that big of a deal. I also usually wear a small, but I ordered a medium. it fits perfectly, but would have been too small if I had went with my normal sizing. Definitely order a size up unless you are looking for something snug. This is lightweight, which is what I wanted as I intend to wear a flannel underneath. Would be best as a fall/spring jacket. It is not lined. This jacket is much better quality than I expected for the price, the material is actually pretty decent.

I purchased this dress on short notice (my dress order on a different website was cancelled!!), and thank goodness for Prime because this dress was very similar to the dress I was originally going to order, and it arrived very quickly (Expedited 1 day shipping).

Pros:
Package arrived on time.
The dress size
Dress is as pictured, the color was more like the second picture and following, not like the bright blue in the first picture.
This corset lacing really flatters people with an hourglass-shaped body. I have sort of a rectangular shaped body, and the corset didn't make a perfect ""V"" down the middle, but it still fit well.
Great price, compared to dresses from other websites (Promgirl, Simplydresses, etc).

Cons:
The lining and chiffon were wrinkled, but can be easily fixed by using a steamer.
Dress is super long: you might have to pay a tailor to hem it for you. Or ask a friend or family member.
The corset goes pretty low down the dress, and lifts the dress awkwardly if you ever intend to hold the front of the dress to avoid stepping on it.
The section under the arms is beaded and slightly uncomfortable.

4,"My son wears a 6T to 6.5T and the description said the shoes are about a full size off, to go bigger. So I got an 8 and they fit. They are great looking shoes and he loooves them, they are fun, for sure.

The quality is great as far as I saw, thick canvas, nice color, solid heel. The only thing I noticed is one of the air bladders in the show that puffs the air through the squeaker was harder to deactivate when I tried them it with my hand. Think of a whoopie cushion that goes back to full capacity, versus one that only fills back half way. Ultimately, when my son tried them, they both work and sound the same so we kept them.

I will actually be ordering more.

They send extra squeakers too.","So fun, great quality and look."

4,This flannel is super cute. When I received it however it looked as though there were little fuzz balls on it like it was used. I wasn't too concerned cause after washing it looks better. The fabric is a little stiff and tight in the shoulders so definitely more of a dressy kind of shirt. It looks great with leggings and covers your butt. I would order one or two sizes up though because it runs small. I normally wear a large and I ordered XL and it fit a little snug.

I did follow the measurements, which typically are given as one side (and then you multiply it by two to get the all around fit)(not the case here). Still, it's a nice sweater and a good price. Plus it got here much faster than I expected! I'd call it a ""large"" rather than ""oversized"".","Nearly accurate description, still super cute."

I always wash everything before wearing, and usually clothes have some sort of mild smell from manufacturing/packaging.  I'm 5'5"" and it fits perfectly.

4,"I bought this bag in Germany and I absolutely LOVE it. It is the right size, it has a big main compartment, with 3 slide pockets and a zippered pocket inside. On the outside it has 4 compartments for small items, such as keys, lip gloss, security access cards and remote door devices, phone. My Galaxy S5 fits in one of the front pockets. The smaller pockets are really small and there's not much that can fit in there except some cash, a credit or ID card you need to access real quick. And there's another outside zippered compartment which is larger and you can stash bigger items in it such as glasses, keys, small coin purse, make up etc.
It's a great bag, lovely soft and smooth leather. Not super big but it can hold your essentials without becoming overstuffed and heavy. The bag itself does not stand upright on its own, but it is not a problem for me. The zippered compartment opens wide enough so you can clearly see where everything is inside. I gave it a 4 out of 5 starts because I would have wanted it in a darker brown, which was not available. I have treated it with an anti stain spray and hope it stays as beautiful as when I got it. Where I bought it they told me that the more you use it the more beautiful it will get. I hope so as I intend to use it a lot. It is expensive but it is certainly worth it. It is well made and the stitching is very beautiful. And yes, it is made in China, but who cares.

After using the bag for a couple of weeks I still could not get to really like the pale colored leather, so I decided to darken it with brown Kiwi polish. It turned out exactly the way I wanted it: a really vintage look. It appears to have been around for ages. I love it!",The perfect bag

4,"Well I'm a bit confused.
Originally, when I had placed the order the product title said Men's 2 Pack Crew Neck Cotton Ribbed Tank (Small, 4pcsGreen).
Clearly reading it now it had conflicting information that I didn't pay a single bit of attention to. All I saw was ""Small, 4pcsGreen"" so I ordered 3 of them expecting to get receive 12 total.  So I was slightly disappointed when the product arrived and there was 3x 2 packs totaling in 6 tanks.  Only to look back at the order and see that it does in fact say 2 Pack.
In terms of quality of the product; meh.. looks cheaply made, the color wasn't consistent, but they fit right.  I'm using them as an undershirt so I can't complain too much.

I'll know for sure on Christmas, but I would recommend ordering a size up. Otherwise, I expect this would be a good purchase.

UPDATE: The extra large (XL) was way too small. My dad thought it was a very nice shirt and we were both disappointed at how small and form-fitting it was. Order at least one size larger than you normally wear.","It's a very soft material and looks nice, but I'm concerned about the sizing"

The only thing I wasn't keen on was that the skirt fell well below my knee (I'm 5'8""), which kind of dates it.  I took up the hem and it is absolutely perfect.  Beautiful fabric.  The skirt is a pencil skirt and the cut is very flattering.  Can someone explain to me why they dress the models in sizes that are too big for them.  It does nothing to help sales.

I am very pleased with the quality and fit however after a day of wearing them my toes have lost their skin and are bleeding my toe next to big toe and my pinky are chaffing at bottom of toe the band is cutting them the arch part and heel felt great just wish i could find a way to keep them from ripping my skin off so after getting a return label from seller and I was told I can only return shoes if never worn *sigh) I thought hard on how I can accomodate the shoes for my feet. Since I paid $15.00 for size 9 and they are now $85 !!! I cut the leather between the toes and that lifted the upper leather where it rubbed all my skin off.

Also, it wasn't clear in the description but these shirts ship from overseas; make sure you can wait to get it 10 to 14 days later.

Given the price I paid and after gaining a little experience with laundering the shirt, it's really nowhere near as bad as I initially stated.

I received this Clementine tank at a discounted rate for my unbiased opinion.

Well, it's been almost a year since I purchased these. I wear them maybe 3 times a week, and they're kinda falling apart by now.

4,"I've used a bunch of solutions and these are the third choice I'd use the easiest to use.

The problem these have is enough force or enough time the shirt can still come out.

The pro though is it's easy to find which shirt you wore yesterday if you are like me and leave things in your front pocket of your shirt. It also works well for a while so light tasks and it's going to stay put. It's pretty easy so far in my couple days of using it to keep on compared to shirt stays or wearing an elastic belt to keep your shirt in.

Both those options do a better job though. So it depends what you are doing that day. Are you needing to absolutely make a good impression and not worry about tucking in your shirt or do you just want your shirt to stay where it should be for work and day to day? It's definitely better than nothing at all.",These aren't the best. 50 percent effective.

4,"Two things to note here.

First off, they did not have this t-shirt (Rosie We Can Do It Soccer) in stock, but the guys e-mailed me right away and asked me if I wanted Amazon credit or my money back.  I like the designs so much I just ordered a different style of shirt, but with the same parameters (size and whatnot).

Secondly, I got the one with the Queen's head that says ""The Yanks are Coming"".  Shirt looks great.  Fits me kinda short on the torso, but my wife says I have a long torso.

At any rate, I got great service.  The t-shirt is good.  I plan on buying from them again.",Worthwhile investment
4,"Arrived quickly, as described.  Fit great.",Fit great.
4,"Pros: Fits as expected. Good quality. Dresses up nice.

I bought a bunch of U.S. Polo's traditional style, v-neck t-shirt style , and oxford button up style.

I'm an adult medium; juniors large. At first, I bought a XL because some people said Polo's fit large; they don't. People are just in denial about their size. I then had to return it to get a L (thanks Amazon free returns), because I wanted a fitted fit. And actually the oxford style fits like an adult, so I had to get a medium.

It's a good quality shirt, especially for the price; averaging between $10-15/shirt. I was able to replace my entire wardrobe for cheap. Plus with all the styles and colors, it doesn't look boring.

It also dresses up nice with some fitted tan/black khakis and low heel booties (in fall)/sandals (in spring). I work in a lacks business casual environment. I was looking to replace my wardrobe because it looked dopey or like I was wearing my mother's clothes.  This dresses up nice for a lacked business casual environment; and something about fitted clothes and (even a low) heel gives any woman confidence :)

I work in IT. There is a trend in white collar jobs to move towards ""uniforms"" because you get tired of worrying about what you're going to wear. You have Steve Jobs and the infamous black turtleneck. Mark Zuckerberg and the infamous grey t-shirt. I've even read a few articles in women's mags that women are starting to do the same. So that's what I was looking to do. I choose Polo because I wanted variety of color/style, but the concept of a ""uniform.""

Overall, it's nice, even for an adult business casual look.",Fits as expected. Good quality. Dresses up nice.

4,"The good news is I FINALLY found a shirt that fits pretty well.  Since the body of a shirt is predicated on the neck size, normally when I find something that fits my neck, the rest fits more like a sheet than a shirt.  I'm so excited about the fit that I may be marking this shirt too high, given it's flaws.

My gripes are these:

In an odd design choice, this shirt was made with most buttons sewn with white thread vertically through the button holes and ONE with sewn with black thread horizontally through the button (see included photo).  This makes it look like you lost a button and did a sloppy repair.  I originally thought I received a shirt someone else had returned this way.  So, I ordered a replacement....which came with the same button arrangement.  Now I feel compelled to sew the ODD button like the others so I don't look like a slob at work.  I have to keep it because it's sooooo hard to find this fit.

Also, the shirt is very thin.  You can literally see through it so, depending on your complexion and features, an undershirt may be required, not optional.",The good news is I FINALLY found a shirt that fits ...

I wear either a 6.5 or 7, these are 6.5 and almost too short. Arch support is negligible. I like the low heel. The navy color is true. Would rate it a 5 if there were better arch support, and the soles were more cushiony.  But still, they are great!",Comfortable dressy navy sandal

4,"This is a very pretty bracelet.  The blue topaz is a very light blue, and is lighter than it appears in the picture, but it is nice.  There are supposed to be diamonds somewhere but I couldn't see them.  The bracelet is small and delicate and fits my wrist nicely.  It is not flashy at all but really subtle and pretty.  The clasp is really strong; in fact, I couldn't get the bracelet off the first time I put it on and had to really work at it before I was able to figure out how to get it off.  It has prongs on the outside of the clasp for additional security.  The bracelet comes in a very nice gift box.

This is a nice bracelet suitable for dressy occasions or casual wear.  I'm not a big jewelry wearer but this is a piece I will enjoy wearing. Overall this is a really pretty bracelet.",Very pretty bracelet
4,"I absolutely love this backpack. The pocket arrangements are great, I love the smaller pocket on top for my phone and other small stuff. The only problem is that the backpack does NOT fit most 15"" laptops as advertized. My laptop is fairly slim and exactly 15"" wide - I can't even zip the sleeve shut. However, a 13-14 inch laptop should fit perfectly. I wish the sleeve were bigger because I love everything else about this bag. I bought this bag directly from the OGIO website and will be returning it because of the laptop issue.","Too small for 15"", but otherwise great"

She wore it at least 7 times for different Halloween events and it did fine though.

So, these fit ""as expected,"" given those two details.  The bottom of this style (new multicolor pattern, blues/yellow/orange/green/white/black--tag says they're made in USA) has a hemmed ankle, and is about 2 inches too long for me to wear flats.  Nothing a wedge can't handle, though.  The waist is comfortable and not tight, but snug enough to hold them up.  I like that I can wear it high-waisted or fold it down to be low-rise.  I also bought a pair in the sweet green flower print and the teal and white paisley print (made in China) -- these 2 pair were not hemmed/unfinished ankles, and are about 4-6 inches too long.  As they are, I think I'll have to cut off a few inches to keep them from dragging the floor.  I did choose patterns that don't have a horizontal stripe, as many reviewers (and some of the pictures by the vendor) revealed that the pattern lined up funny at the butt seam.  Would have given 5 stars, but there was no mention of one having finished ankle hems and the others having no hem.  I ordered from this vendor because another I was looking at DID mention there was no hem on their pants.  Still, I do like the pants, and think a quick straight cut across the legs will fix them with no need to hem/sew.  Happy with the purchase, shipped super-fast!",Long legs or a high wedge required -- but CUTE & COMFY!

4,"I would give this a 4 1/2, actually, because it is really beautiful if you want to make a statement on your wrist.  It's a reasonably large bracelet, and because it is highly polished, it really stands out. Even so, it looks ""richer,"" not gaudy, because of the nice design and the cut-outs which make it appear more delicate despite its good size (i placed a dollar bill in it, and it's nearly the exact width of the bill, and the leaf portion covers GW's head, as u can see in the pic).

The bracelet is a solid oval shape, and does not bend, so you should be aware of the size you're getting, in case your wrist is either very small or very large. That said, it is well made, hinged on one side, and the clasp has a great secondary clip to prevent it from accidentally coming off. I wasn't careful to ""click"" down the clasp in a rush while getting ready for work, and it fell off in my closet! be sure to use and check the clasp- the bracelet is a bit on the weightier side (not heavy, but you know it's on your wrist), and easily opens if you pull it while the button is lightly depressed.",Beautiful- Great for Silver Lovers

Why because there is really no ventilation so your toes are basically being treated like Vienna sausages being boiled your feet may smell like that when you take them off in temperatures over 90 degrees. Now this has just been my experience with the shoe, there simply wasn't enough ventilation in the shoe.  But what I can guarantee is its good for rugged, rocky conditions and I did get a lot of compliments on the shoe.  But the funny thing about getting compliments on your shoes it that two weeks later you will see two or three chicks wearing the same type shoe....",Good Shoe- Just Not When its Hot

4,"If you want to delight a 5 year old, buy her these shoes.  I bought them for playing dress up only.  She wears them everywhere and all the time, so there are a few things to note:

**The soles are slippery.  Sister has busted it many many times in the middle of a store--usually the ones with the vinyl composition tile that is found in most stores.  I made no effort to scuff the soles for more traction--we just don't run in them and I try to hold her hand.

**The rhinestones have started to come off.  There are still plenty on there, but if you need these shoes to look mint after multiple all day wearings, I doubt they can do that.

**I ordered a size 10 for my daughter who wears a 9.5.  I thought we would have some growing room.  They fit perfectly out of the box, though I think she'll want to wear them til she can't stuff her feet in them anymore.

**After lots of wear, the velcro holding the strap in place has lost a bit of its stick.  The shoes still stay on, but maybe not as tightly.

The colors were even brighter than they look online; I'd call them fluorescent.  There's a built-in crinoline slip layer to give it a cute poofiness.  The bloomers are rather see-through, so diaper colors will show up, but it didn't bother me because the dress was plenty long to hide the diaper most of the time.  The reason I couldn't give it five stars is that when washed the bright pink dye on the outer layer of the dress did run and get on the inner white lining.  I suspected this would happen, so rather than machine wash it gentle cycle like the tag says, I briefly and gently washed it by hand in cold water.  I didn't even get the cute curly ribbons wet for fear they'd lose their shape.  The bleeding of the colors isn't bad enough to ruin the look of the dress after the one wash I've given it, but please wash it carefully if you buy it.",Bright and adorable

This is one awesome coat, it's so warm, on a very cold snowy night I was walking home in this coat and literally started sweating.

4,"I ordered several YoursClothing casual shirts from Amazon for travel and was not disappointed. They fit wonderfully for those like me with larger waists and hips. The back tie helps to shape the blouse. The fabric is viscose and so drapes nicely. The beads and sequins on the bodice are subtle but add some pretty bling.

Two things to know: the neutral color is not white but is beige, and the cuffs of the sleeves never look sharply folded up as they do in this photo. The sleeves are longer and must roll up with a tab. Because of the fabric, they look quite floppy.","Great fit for larger women, and a little bling"

Luckily, I have small feet and managed to fit both of them inside. The USB charger that plugs into your computer warms it up slightly, it would've been nice if it had a light or an on/off switch. If not in use, you can discreetly hide the plug in a zipper side pocket which also allows you to remove the heat pad completely if you so desire. It has rubber knobs at the bottom to prevent from slippage on smooth floors (though I don't see why you need it if you can't really walk in these). Overall, it is exactly what I was looking for when I am on the couch watching TV and putting my feet up on the coffee table during cold winter nights.

I've never had to break the canvas or corduroy ones in, so I was discouraged at first.  But after a full day of wearing them with socks and walking around, I can wear them comfortably sock-free.

NOTE: I am not violent with my hoodies, nor did I ever put anything heavy in it.

This dress fit me as I hoped and actually there is plenty more room for a 12-14 size person to wear this comfortably. Fabric was a bit stiff out of the bag but softened after washing on delicate cycle, inside-out. It washed easy - had to get rid of the adverse scent of chemicals.

Beach thong and flip-flop weather is coming, and here I am still wearing a parka and mukluks. So I decided to get my summer prep freak on -- STAT!

Every summer, my wife worries whether she can find a bathing suit that fits. So I bought her this one -- I figured, there's so little to it, it has to fit! It's like wearing three rubber bands. How could that not be comfortable?

She saw things a bit differently. And told me in no uncertain terms that she was NOT wearing ""that thing"" outside the house. I said, ""Great!"" Because I thought that meant she'd be wearing it INSIDE the house.

Turns out, she's not wearing it inside the house, either. In fact, she threw it at me and won't even look at it any more. So I've been using it.

Not as a bathing suit, of course. I don't have the equipment to hold some of those rubber bands up. But I found it makes a great alternative to dental floss. You can really get in behind the molars with it, and my bicuspids have never felt sexier. Great product!",I'm at a Floss for Words!

Wanted a pair of hiking shoes for my trip to Peru. These are perfect. Withstood rain, mud, slick surfaces, rocky areas, and most of the Inca ruins of the sacred valley. I beat these up bad and they just kept going, one right after another. I was doing well over 10k steps per day in these and to my delight, very little knee and ankle pain.

4,"These are good quality. I have been using them to weight lift for over a month now and I like them. They are comfortable, but the only issue I had is the legs on them are either longer than I expected, the guy in the picture is wearing it over his stomach, or I have shorter legs than I though lol. All in all I would order these again.",Useful
4,"Pros:
Beautiful, classy, elegant looking piece from an arms length distance.
Decent build quality.
Hypoallergenic.
Inexpensive.

Cons:
Metal-work has the usual ""machined edge"" look of mass market crafted jewelry.
Stones are not quite as clear as I hoped.
Pattern is unevenly spaced.
Chain is a bit on the fragile side.

Overall though, because of the price, it's a decent value.

Note: I received a significant discount for this product in exchange for this review.","Nice piece, good value."

4,I bought the pale green (mint?) version as a Mother's Day gift for my mom. She loves it. Just the right size for somene who doesn't need to carry an overnight bag. The outer compartment keeps her cell phone from being buried and the long strap lets he keep her hands free.,Ideal for women who don't need to carry everything they own
4,Beautiful and well made as per your usual L.A.M.B. but the sewing inside the right foot rubs my pinkie toe and oh the pain!

4,"This Carole Hochman robe is a pretty, soft pink. The material is a bit stiff, even after the first wash, however, I feel it will soften with time. It's hard to find a plus-size short robe with long sleeves (or at least in my experience) that zips up. I anticipate wearing it a long time due to the quality of material and construction. I ordered a 2X first, as that's what I usually order in tops and sweaters, and based on the sizing information available. But when it arrived, it was pretty big. Re-ordered a 1X and, even after washing, still feel it to be roomy enough for comfort.",Material a bit stiff but great fit

I didn't get these when I saw them in the store at full price of $150 because I don't believe they're worth that to me, but since they put them on sale for $44, I didn't even have to think about it.",Good shades at a great deal.

4,"These are great! The material is so soft I want to cuddle it. The colors are exactly as shown, and the fit is cute, comfortable, and perfect.
So why not 5 stars? One leg was ever so slightly longer than the other.
It's not such a big deal to me since I can sew and just hemmed up the longer leg, but to others this might be an inconvenience. However, this could have been a simple factory defect on just the pair I got.
Bottom line? I definitely recommend for any Wonder Woman fan looking for something cozy.",Why not 5 stars?

4,I ordered this Elsa coronation costume for my 3 yr old daughter. I ordered 4-5 afraid it was going to be too small and oh no. It was too big. I think it's like a size 6 . It is a gorgeous soft gown. And the cape is long and beautifully detailed. A plus is it has no glitter and it's zippered. Hopefully as she grows she will still like the frozen movie and she can enjoy. Very gorgeous dress. No mesh so no itchy. Happy about dress I just wish I would have ordered a smaller size. Hopefully if I was 2 times it may shrink. So order true size of you want it to fit perfect.,I think it's like a size 6

4,"Quality feels solid.  I like the clasp which is very secure.  Watch is heavy and thick compared to my citizen watch.  it's got a large face so I think it would look best on men with above average wrist sizes.  I do feel like taking off the watch at night for some reason.

Bezel sits up above the rest of the watch, so I wonder if over time the bezel will take some scratches that it would not have if it was lower into the watch.

The small dials are a little hard to read.  It takes me a little while to read the date, which is the most important of the 3 small dials.

I've had the watch for about a week, and there are some barely noticeable scratches on the band.  Glow in the dark hands are a nice plus, but they don't seem very bright.

As others have mentioned, the box the watch came in worthy of being in a jewelers store.  Very well done.

For the price, it's a great watch.  Overall pleased with it.  I'll keep it until the bezel gets scratched up.",Very good watch for the price.

I would have given it 5 stars but the band is all wrong.  On my wrist at least the free end hung over the watch face and it looks like you have an incorrect band for the watch.  I had a jeweler replace it with a black calfskin band and transfer over the rose gold clasp.  Now I think it looks perfect.  Working well so far.",All but the band is perfect

One off-setting thing to note, though, is that I think the slim fit cut was part of the reason my dad wanted the additional size larger.  He's in his sixties, so his physique isn't the same as the ""model"" for the shirt in the picture.  Even if it was, he's not really the type to wear a form-fitting shirt.","Nice, but VERY Small, especially with slim fit"

4,"The watch is absolutely beautiful.  However, the color isn't as rose gold as some other watches, such as those made by michael kors etc.  The one downside to this watch is that as someone who works at an office, the watch rubs against the desk.

4,"Beautiful boots. Received compliments the first time i wore them out. Things ive noticed: only the heel has some grip, the rest of the sole is leather so super slippery. Not sure why they would do that. The foot of the boot is super sturdy (like super stiff leather) but the leg of the boot is super soft unlined perforated leather so you must be careful not to tug too hard when putting it on. Ive ripped the leather a tiny bit near the zip. With regards to sizing, I found them true to size. I am usually a 9 - 10 depending on the shoe and I got a 9.5. If you have a range like me id go the upper range to fit socks comfortably and get the boot on more easily. I cant imagine the foot of the shoe stretching as it is so solid. Someone previously mentioned this but they are a little harder to put on compared with boots that have a full zip. Also the soft leather is gorgeous but Im assuming it will stretch so thats why theyve added the leather lace at the back. Overall a great purchase Ive wanted flat knee high tan boots for a while and these are definitely different from what you see in the shops. Gorgeous features just wish the sole wasn't leather as its impractical.","Gorgeous, true to size, a few small gripes"

4,"This is a fantastic rolling underseater carry-on bag. It definitely fits under the seats on Southwest Airlines planes (but doesn't leave any room to stretch your legs). It rolls so quietly you can barely hear it. It has lots of room inside. I had enough room for a pair of slippers, shorts, tank tops, underwear, dress, makeup/hair products, essentials, and still room for snacks, sunglasses, and my wallet. I took one star off because the zippers  stick, which can be annoying and also causes me concern that they may break. I'm hoping they just need to be used more often and that they won't stick as often after awhile.","Roomy, yet fits under plane seats"

However, I'm very disappointed in the color, it is literally nothing close to the product photo. The photo for the coral color looks muted orange, but the color in person is straight pink. Like, pepto pink. The jacket is still difficult to get on and off like my previous smaller version, but once on,  it fits like a dream.

4,"Nice one piece for a mom of four to chase after kids in the pool, while feeling somewhat stylish. Strapless top stays up well. Removed the breast padding, as it kept moving into weird positions and making the suit look and feel odd. Still nice without the padding, thanks to good lining.

I was a little surprised that they are as blasted as they are in the front, it opens almost all the way up to the pockets, leaving room for one wrong move = underwear flash.

4,"Somewhat baggy in the waist, but it's easily remedied.  The scales wear off, even just in storage when I haven't worn them.  But they are as they appear and are very cute.

4,"My expectations weren't so high for a $13.99 dress, but I was hopeful. The color is as pictured. The pockets are functional. The fabric has a little stretch to it. The silhouette is amazing. The dress doesn't seem to ride up.  I'm giving four stars instead of five, because the listed measurements aren't accurate. I purchased this dress to wear to church. The dress hits right at my knee, according to my height and the listed measurement, it should be a little longer, but it still looks nice. When buying dresses on Amazon, the bust measuring 32-33 inches work for me. With this dress, I don't have as much bust room as listed. It almost didn't work for me. I then decided to try it on again with a minimizer bra, and I'm happy it worked. The slit is kind of high, but I'm short, so it's okay. The dress does buckle a bit at the zipper on me.  Overall, I'm satisfied, and I would recommend this dress. Just keep those things in mind when ordering your size. I ordered a size medium.

I haven't worn this dress yet. I just tried it on to check the fit. It just arrived at my door. Out of the 40+ reviews, no one has posted a pic, so maybe this will help someone out. I normally don't buy Amazon dresses without someone posting a pic, but for $13.99 and so many positive reviews, I took a risk, and I'm so glad I did.

4,"Why this necklace merits 4to 4.5 stars.

1. It is a very attractive necklace. It isn't too much, and adds just the right amount of bling to an outfit.

2. The packaging is nice and makes it seem more expensive than it is. The necklace is enclosed in a nice box.

3. The chain is dainty and yet seems pretty sturdy. There is a well-made heavy clasp. The only thing is that I wish it was 20' versus 18'. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't seem like a chocker and is definitely long enough, but I would have liked for it to hang down a little further.

4. This necklace is one piece. While it looks like it is a pendant, it is actually a piece that is fastened/attached to the chain. The infinity pendant does not move, but instead stays in place.

5. This necklace is a nice color (rhodium plated sterling silver). It looks like it is white gold. ** I may have to revisit this particular part of my review in the future. In terms of the rhodium plating I will say this.....while this necklace is sterling silver, I have had several pieces of white gold pieces of jewelry (ranging from 14 to 18 carat gold) that have been rhodium plated. There is something about my skin that reacts with certain jewelry, especially those that are rhodium plated that cause the metal (gold usually) to discolor or turn yellowish gold looking over time. Meaning I have to continuously get my jewelry rhodium plated each year. Therefore, I am curious to see how the color of this necklace holds over time (say the next few months). I have never tried rhodium plated silver and am not sure if it will tarnish or change colors. Of course, the biggest difference could be that my wedding rings are gold and I don't remove them, while I will probably only wear this necklace on occasion and all of it won't be exposed to my skin.

6. The infinity pendant is cute, and is made from the quote ""Love the life you live, Live the life you love"". I like that the pendant is formed from the words, and not written on a piece of metal, because it gives the necklace more character. The wording or quotes are separated by small stones (which are kind of at the top and bottom). The stones are small and I consider them to be more of tiny accents, which don't cheapen the look. However, be forewarned, the message or writing is not easy to read (or it might be my middle aged eyes), unless you are in a well lite area. And from a distance, it looks like a nice ""figure eight"". I am not sure if making the words bigger would take away from the daintiness of the neckless.

7. This necklace is affordable for anyone. Priced at under $27 makes it the perfect token for brides to give their bridal party, as favors for a Sweet 16 birthday party or any occasion (birthday, Christmas, etc).

Overall, this necklace merits a 4 to 4.5 (deducted for the small writing and the desire for a longer chain).",Fashionable and affordable. 4-4.5

I followed the fitting instructions, but the cap feels somewhat small, but close enough that I'll be keeping it. The size selection range doesn't allow for the nearest best fit. So you're only allowed a slightly snug fit or a too large a fit. This was true for me anyway. Hopefully it will stretch just a bit with wear, and if not, I'll get it stretched at a hat shop.

Contacted the seller and exchanged it for a medium that fit much better. Service was fantastic. Overall I like the coat and gave it 4 stars. I really don't like the permanent bib but that is a personal preference. Fabric feels a bit stiff but this is not a $600+ coat so that is to be expected.,Good coat but not great

4,"I bought the Scarleton Trendy Satchel in Natural in Dec. 2015.  LOVE the design of this bag! Design is just like I want... three big pockets: two big easy access pockets on either side of one middle pocket that has a zipper for unmentionables. The handles are just right length for hanging on my shoulder, forearm or in my hand. Size is just as pictured in my opinion. (Does include an optional hook-on shoulder strap, but I don't use it. I use the hooks intended for the shoulder strap for my keys! Very convenient.) The small outside zipper pocket holds my cell and glasses which are ""grab quickly"" items at the store or in the car. The quality seems good for the price. I would give it a 5 STAR if I could have had a choice of colors.. maybe denim blue or medium brown, which is what I really wanted. Why does it come in only one solid color? Color is fairly true to picture.",REALLY like my new bag! Wish it had more color options.
4,"This bag is really beautiful and the color, called ""soft blue"" is just gorgeous - a touch of periwinkle in a bright, light blue.  By the way, all the Rebecca Minkoff bags in this color seem to be selling out.  I thought that the bag was quilted on both sides but did not observe the pictures enough to realize that the quilting is only on one side.  I can live with that; but what is not disclosed adequately in the pictures is that the strap is colored blue only on ONE side.  The other side is a raw tan, which was a great disappointment (hence only 4 stars).  This to me is an unnecessary flaw - how much more would it have cost to have both sides of the all-important strap match the rest of the bag?  It makes it look unfinished.  However, I like a small cross body bag and the ""soft blue"" color is my all time favorite and goes with lots of stuff I have.","Great looking bag in a gorgeous color, but the strap has a flaw"
4,I really like my sweater. Its big like it says. I'm 5'9 so my arms are long. The sweater arm length isn't that long but its not as sort either. I wish that it was longer to wear with leggings but over all its cute and I'm not a so small or big person. It does have a little smell but nothing that can't be aird out and then washed.plus it can faster than the expected due date.,I really like my sweater
4,"Got these for a trip to Orlando, Fl. Used them to walk around the parks at Disney for an extended weekend, and neither my feet feel nor the shoes are any worse for the wear. Sperry Angelfish shoes don't disappoint. I now own 2 sets, and both size 7s fit my size 7 feet perfectly and comfortably right out of the box. They did not need much of a break-in time, if any at all. Great shoe for walking, much more stylish than most shoes marketed for the purpose of walking in and perfect if you don't love the look of sneakers. I only wish they lasted longer. The mesh sides split a little on my last pair after 2 summers worth of moderate use. They also got dirty and are tough to clean, which is why I purchased another pair. I still recommend for style and comfort, but would avoid submerging them in water too much, as even using them on wet grass and puddles will hasten wear and tear. If it does happen to rain or you get splashed on a waterpark ride you won't be uncomfortable, but these are not a good alternative to rain boots or water shoes.","Comfortable and stylish for walking, but not for heavy water use"
4,"Initially they were very comfortable, but as the day went on, they got very uncomfortbble. I think this has to do with the sides of the shoe, they get rather tight and constricting as time goes. I did however find a trick and that is if you figure out where the pressure points are, you can put tape or a bandage over it, and it makes life much better to walk around with them on!","Go 2 Sizes bigger, trust me!"

Hood zips off. There are no bungee straps at the bottom to take the coat in around the legs (not a make of break, just informational). The 2 zippers take a little getting used to, but you can wear the coat with 1 or both zippers zipped. The 2 zippers make for a unique look.

I like the fact that is the company is American and the labor used is American (Amish). I deducted one star, because the drawer comes out completely with no stop; this might be a personal preference issue. My own (imported) jewelry box has drawers that do stop, as in a piece of fine furniture. Another issue is that the draw does not fit snugly enough in the drawer opening; it wobbles from side to side. I plan to remedy this by applying dark brown felt to the sides of the drawer. For the price, I would have thought it would fit correctly, as it would in a piece of fine furniture. I will go ahead and fix it myself and I think that afterward, my husband will enjoy this gift for his watch collection and to store tie pins, collar stays, cuff links and keepsakes.","Quality materials, however it would benefit by a couple of improvements in design"

It binds way better than any big name brand I've had ( underworks, gc2b, etc.)  I'm 5'3, 160 pounds and have a fairly large chest and this binder got me completely flat.  The material is very soft, breathable and pleasant.  I usually wear a medium binder and I needed a large in this brand, so if you're thinking about purchase don't forget to upsize, these are obviously not US sizes. But yeah, great product, incredibly impressed, would definitely recommend to friends and buy again in the future.

4,"Always skeptical of ""OSFA,"" and this item was no exception.  However, this actually DOES fit me, and is relatively comfortable.  The material is soft and is thick enough not to be see-through.  May be sweaty, but haven't worn yet.  The waistband would be REALLY tight if it wasn't so high up.  That helps get it to the smaller part of my torso, so no ""muffin top.""

I'm 5'7"" 140lbs, so I can see how they would be baggy (not great) if you are smaller.  The length is good for me.  I wouldn't suggest ordering if you are too much taller or carry more weight in your waist/hips/bottom or they will likely be uncomfortably tight.

The part I liked the best was that there is actually room for my toes in the toe of the boot.

There are no holes to hold the laces, just the clips/hooks that are normally just at the top few eyelets of the boot.","Good quality, but laces are annoying"

4,"I like the Ecco shoes but they don't make my size.  Beware of the sizing info here.

Amazon, as of today anyway, is claiming here in the selection box that size 43 EU is equal to size 10 US and 42 is a 9 US, but that is not what they have claimed in the past nor what is in the sizing chart.

Ecco and Amazon used to claim and still show in the sizing chart that size 43 was equivalent to a 9/9.5 US and I believe that to have been accurate based on shoes I have tried on, purchased, or returned in the recent past.  Size 42 used to be 8/8.5 which again was accurate IMO.  I wear a size 9 and ECCO shoes are either a bit too big(43) or too small(42).  Such was the case for both casual shoes and golf shoes.  I don't know if the size selection option here is an error or an accurate representation for these particular Tour Hybrid Lion/Burnt Ochre Wingtips. Amazon should correct or clarify the discrepancy. Buyer beware.

I didn't want to rate these but had to in order to post my sizing warning,  My rating is based on my brand experience as I don't own these particular shoes, though I did receive a pair in this model that I liked out of the box, but had to return because they didn't fit.",Beware of Sizing

The quality of the canvas and stitching is nice, and seems like it will last, and the price of $20-ish was perfect.  However, one of the snaps broke within about a month of using it.  Since I purchased it in early December for Christmas and it didn't start getting used until mid-January, my return window was up by the time it broke.  I'm sure I could have contacted the seller, but I didn't.  Still, I really like the bag and the price, so I will likely replace it with the same in a few months.","Great bag, faulty snap"

4,"These shoes are comfortable, seem sturdy, and look nice (I've been surprised at how well they tend to match most casual clothes). They came with both grey and white laces (cool!) and seem to resist getting scuffed up reasonably well. If this is all your looking for, as I was, this is a great shoe for you!

However, I noticed while writing this review, that these shoes are marked as athletic running shoes. I run a decent amount, and these shoes are NOT what I would consider good running shoes in any sense. You can pretty much tell from the photo; the bottom of the shoe is completely flat and almost uniform thickness, actually running in them just feels clunky (the shoes do not roll through a stride), and finally the shoe has very poor traction. This last reason is why I also would avoid these shoes for just about any sport since the traction on them is really low (this is the reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5). But again, if you're not using them for sports, these are a good deal.",Great casual shoes. (but don't buy them as runners)

I will say that, if you want to wear it over sweaters, you might consider sizing up. It is more of a slim fitting coat. The coat will look great as casual wear or for a more formal occasion. This coat is so nice that I sm considering buying 2 more; one for my other daughter & one for me!",Nice coat! I might buy 2 more!
4,"Great jacket. Only thing is, I think this isn't an official Levi's jacket. The quality is great but still. The red tag on the pocket does not say Levi's. Also, you'd think there would be that classic Levis tag on the inside under the collar but there isn't. Its just a made in China tag.

They fit fine in the thighs when I stand still, but in all other places they bunch up; especially on my claves and stomach area. When walking they do start to slowly fall down and if you are around my size don't expect them to hug and help shape anything. They do nothing to accentuate my rear-end or my hips, but that is to be expected with a one size type item. These fit like large leggings would on me, but other than the fact they're too large, they're fantastic. Like I said the print is beautiful and looks really clear. You can clearly tell who everyone is and they're quite comfortable and not see thru. They do feel a little strange, though, but as you wear them you get used to the sorta slippery, silky feeling.

5,"It was a little tight at first - so tightly sprung that it was at first difficult to get around the two layers of tie. After about 6 uses, it's settling in and I am become more deft at applying it. Looks OUTSTANDING. So clean and simple. Can work as understated twinkle of class or that kind of bohemian throwback (dare I say hipster) look from a Heineken commercial. I'm no hipster. Rather, this does two things for me. 1) it meets the practical need I had of taming my ties in wind or activity (I often doff or forego the sport coat, often wearing shirt and tie under armored motorcycle jacket) 2) it raises the bar (pun intended) when it comes to my wardrobe, especially BECAUSE I often lack a sport coat/suit jacket but also because my workplace is almost exclusively business casual and this exceeds that just enough to signify classiness without sticking out too far.","What will this accessory say about you, or do for you?"

I've worn a corset from boobs to hips before and could barely sit down in it, however, this corset was perfect for a ren faire, where I ran around, all day without complaint. I love that it has the loops, and was able to incorporate it into my outfit. I went by the company's sizing chart (NOT amazon's estimated one) and chose the size appropriate for my dimensions. The corset fit just as it should have, and once I had the back laced to my size, it was easy to take on and off with the hook clasps in the front.",Loved it

The ones I received do not look quite as smooth as in the picture. I expected this as they are handmade. I find it adds to their charm.

They are truly unique, one of a kind. I love strange, large, unique jewelry!

I have to mention the size and length of the plugs. They are huge! When worn, they barely graze the tops of my shoulders. I was surprised by this. It is a bonus for me because I love large jewelry, but I thought I would warn those who are expecting something smaller. These are definitely eye-catching and I love them!","I love strange, large"

I have arthritis in that foot now and all sorts of pain if I wear shoes that don't fit me perfectly. I literally took these shoes out of the box, put them on, and wore them for the duration of the day.  Today is the third time I have worn them comfortably all day long.

5,"Really love this top. I am 5'8"" and 150 pre-pregnancy, about 165 now at 26 weeks. I was a size M before and the size M fits perfectly now and I'm sure will fit for the rest of my pregnancy. Plenty of space to grow a belly but not like a tent or sack. It is long enough to cover front and back with leggings. I got the white, which I do have to wear a nude tank top underneath or you can see the waistline of those lovely maternity pants through it. But it's soft and very nice material and works for a professional work environment. Also the neckline is not too low at all (some of the product photos make it look super low); you can't even see my nude tank top in the v-neck space when I have it on. It's a very classy neckline with the gathered fabric. Looks like it will work for nursing afterward too.","Long, soft, chic"

It is so large and holds everything I need it to hold and then some! I get more compliments on this bag than any other bag I have. The handles are reinforced and sturdy, unlike many other totes. And I don't know if it is because of the perforation, but it shows no visible signs of wear and I carry it non-stop and do not baby it. I have this in black and it is my go to bag for any occasion. Perfect for dressier outfits or casual. It really is the best bag I have ever had.",FABULOUS bag!

5,"LOVE this suit. For a busty lady who finds bathing suit shopping an absolute nightmare, I was surprised how well this fit. Strongly recommend for anyone large-chested who needs underwire support. I bought the 34F and it is a bit of a struggle to get into (I have to have somebody clip the back for me), but once you're in there, you're not going anywhere. Very secure. The sizing is UK sizing, not US, so pay attention to that. I already knew my size in Panache so I was alright, but do some googling if you haven't bought Panache before. Some reviewers are saying that it has a short torso and doesn't work for taller people. I'm 5'4"" and it fits great....can't speak for heights taller than that!","Very supportive! Busty ladies, take note!"
5,This jacket is so cute and fuzzy! I almost didn't buy reading the reviews of it making everything fuzzy..then when I did get it i was afraid to wear it under my jacket in fear I would ruin my jacket. Afraid to wash it with other things because the fuzzy would ruin everything. WELL APPARANTLY REVIEWS ARENT ALWAYS CORRECT! this is my favorite go to jacket! Lightweight. Soft. Cuddly.

5,"The sweater is beautiful. The wool is so soft, warm and very light. I have the steel blue sweater and the color looks even nicer than expected.

The sweater has a very unusual design with a beautiful shawl collar. I need to admit that when I first unpacked the sweater it puzzled me for 30 seconds as I didn't know how to put it on. It seemed to be missing an opening for the head but then I remembered the product pictures and put the sleeves first and then folded out the collar.

I fit in large size but I wish the product was also offered in xl size, then I would have more of this extra shawl fabric to wrap myself with.

I am considering buying another one in different color in a month or two.

Great sweater, my favorite right now.",Very stylish!
5,"Very cute, but if you have low arches you should wear extra insoles. I got them a half size larger than my usual shoe size, and they fit perfectly.

5,"Nice textured sweater. I bought the black-A6 style. It appears gray and black in the picture, but it is actually all black. The material is soft and kind of similar to yarn. It is not tightly knitted so I plan to wear a shirt under it since it is see through in areas. I ordered my normal size and it is long and loose fitting. I decided I like that with this sweater. I machine washed it in a delicates bag because of the possibly delicate stitching. I came out fine. I do expect it to be prone to snagging. It is very pretty and comfortable. It gets 5 stars for now, but I will have to see how well it holds up this winter. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review.","Comfortable, Textured, Maybe Delicate"

5,"I get regular compliments on this jacket. After being introduced to the brand through a personal shopping service you may have heard about, I found this on Amazon at ~75% off the price I was quoted. It is a trendy, versatile jacket that will turn heads. I normally wear a 40R jacket and originally ordered a Size 50 (European sizing?). However it was slightly small and I went up a size to a 52, which fits very well.

Be careful about what to order. I had issues with Amazon delivering the ""Jonas Tonning Jacket"" as the photo did not match the description. Order based off the photo!",Great Jacket - I Bought This One and Another!

Prepregnancy I wore a 4, but thought I was getting big at 28 weeks, so I ordered a 6. It's a little big I feel, though my husband and kids say it's perfect, but the tie can be tied as tight or loose as you need. Will be great for nursing with the bigger size so I'm well covered, not falling out. And it's SO comfortable! Steaming it got the wrinkles out and I'm sure it will travel well.",I love this dress

5,"Wonderful coat. I'm 6' 195 pounds with a belly and broad shoulders. I bought XL and it fits perfect. Still room to wear a sweater under it if needed. It arrived on time and the coat is just as advertised. It's a heavy coat, about 3 pounds, so I'm sure it will work great in cold wet weather. I purchased the coat for an upcoming vacation to The Netherlands. It's going to be cold with lots of rain. I'm confident this coat will fit the bill. I got black and it's really a good looking coat. I have never spent this much money on a coat but after wearing it today in the freezing weather I have no regrets.",great warm coat

5,"Caveat: I am returning this because it's just a smidge too large, but I'm re-ordering it in a smaller size in the hopes that will be the ticket. This dress is BEAUTIFUL. I actually sucked all the air out of the room when I lifted it out of the box. It is truly gorgeous. A couple of things to note: it is HEAVY (the beadwork), but I think that adds to the luxury feel. It is a blouson top, which isn't that obvious from the photo. I love that the straps are wide enough to hide standard bra straps - finding a strapless to accomodate being well-endowed is a special kind of hell. I found this dress to be quite long (I'm 5'6""), but one can either wear very tall heels or have it shortened - I this might make a less formal but no less gorgeous item if properly shortened. If the smaller size works out, I'll try to post a photo. But really, have no doubt - this is STUNNING - like diamonds in the sky!",Gorgeous and Stunning Like A Night Sky

5,"1st, I would like to point out that this shirt is made with Chinese Sizes in mind. Therefore, it would help to pay attention NOT to the size chart so much as the actual size options available (for example, it says X-Large/US 6: this means it's a US size 6). I only put that this product was too small so that others would be aware about the size differences. But I am 5' 2"", 130 lbs, and a 36 D. The size XL fit perfect!

I bought it December 23rd, it was shipped December 25th, and I received it January 9th (which was extremely quick seeing as how my expected delivery date was January 20th - February 5th).

The only thing I wasn't expecting was the color of the sequin strip. I bought the white and ""gold"" shirt but the strip is closer to a pink/rose gold as opposed to just a yellow gold like shown in the picture.

I still love this nonetheless and would definitely recommend it to a friend!",I would like to point out that this shirt is made with ...

5,"I've had this backpack for two years now and have used it on countless weekends, music festivals, plan rides and vacations. It is just now beginning to show any signs of wear (the leather on the drawstrings is beginning to fray) which is expected for the amount of use I've gotten out of it. It's very cute, goes with anything, and I love the diversity of pockets which allow me to really organize my things and not just throw them all into a giant cavernous backpack. Overall, would highly recommend especially for the price.","Great quality, look and functionality"

5,"I REALLY wanted this purse in TAN, but only the Beige color was available.  The purse arrived on time as promised, June 01, 2015 and was very well-packaged in the Amazon.com box.
Upon checking the purse out, I noticed immediately that the stitching on the shoulder strap  wasn't very good: some of the stitches were widely spaced and loose compared to  the other stitching and the stitching on the handles were very ""flimsy.""  I wasn't sure if I should just re-pack the purse and return it . But  seeing how pretty the handbag is, I decided to give the handbag a chance.  I used it for the first time, June 8, 2015.  After only two hours of use, when I returned home, the stitches on the shoulder strap had come loose!!!  AWK!!!  MY BRAND NEW HANDBAG!!!!  Luckily, I have shoulder straps from other handbags and just swapped one with the damaged one.  It looks ok and fits well around my shoulder.  I need the shoulder strap because  I have to use a walker from now on,  after a bad accident  and need both hands to hold on to my walker.  I've always purchased satchels because  I like this style.  I just have to use a shoulder strap from now on and that's not a problem.

The more I look at my new handbag, the more I like it.  I REALLY, REALLY would love to purchase it in TAN, BLUE and BLACK.  Yes, I have a weakness for purses and chocolate!!!  Would I purchase this handbag again?  If the handles hold up and the other colors still aren't available, YES
 I would purchase it again.  Oh!  It's not exactly  BEIGE.  The color is more a very ""light orange"" with crme and a light TAUPE.
 BUT A BEAUTIFUL COLOR!  I prefer THIS color opposed to BEIGE  because if I get ink on it, it won't show as much and it'll be much easier to keep clean!","BEAUTIFUL HANDBAG!  June 09, 2015"

5,"Wow. I suppose that it is the Elastane that does it, but this dress defines form fitting for us. It is cute & very sexy, as long as you are comfortable with the full body hug it provides.

I am about 5 feet 5 inches tall and slim, while our daughter is about the same height and a lot more curvy. The fit of the Medium is a just like a glove for me -- might show a flaw or two more than I really desire (but that is my issue, not an issue with this dress). When our daughter puts this dress on... WOW! Good golly Miss Molly! I had to help her with the zipper as it is not the smoothest zipper we have encountered, and when the dress was finally on... lookout world!

We both liked this dress, agreeing with another reviewer that that the gap between Asian and USA sizing is even wider, by at least one more size, for this dress.  Still, it is a cute, sexy and somewhat risky-feeling dress.

Another great item from ACEVOG that looks just like the pictures in the listing. The only thing that we plan to do it put one stitch at the top of each piece of lace, as seen in the pictures. When worn, those lace pieces tend to flop over forward and get lost, or even point downward. One stitch with dark thread will be unseen, but it will keep the lace standing up as seen in the pictures and that will keep the dress looking fresh all night.

No tag, but the Amazon listing does confirm it is best to hand wash and lay flat to dry when needed (or dry clean). The one we received is the blue and gray dress.

No mention of a warranty, so if an issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this dress gratis from the seller and my daughter and I have worn it to objectively find out how well it looks and wears. My statements here reflect that testing.

If you are looking for a very pretty dress of this size, price, construction and color, then I would highly recommend giving this dress from ACEVOG a try based on our experience with it... just consider going one more size up, unless you really like a serious 'like a glove' fit.

Recommended.

Go for it.","ACEVOG Pencil Dress - Polyester, Elastane & Lace - Form fitting - Cocktail length - Sexy"

They have absolutely no arch support so understand this before buying. I think the quality is equal to brand name skate type shoes out there but it hard to find fabric choices like this.

5,"I love these jeans with the little dragonflies on them. The background is a nice light brown color and the dragonflies which decorate these are an off white color.  So, it is easy to match them up with a top that you probably have already in your closet. If not, it will be an easy task to get a top to blend with them. Previously I have purchased some of NYDJ in a pattern and have had a real struggle finding anything that will go with them, but in this case I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not a difficulty with these.

These jeans fit as expected. I generally wear a 12 petite or a 14 Petite if the jeans run small. I was ablr to slide right into a 12 Petite with no problem, so I recommend that you order your regular size.

Also, the length was correct for me. I am 5'5"" and they hit me right at the ankle, just as they should. Hoorah.

I have really enjoyed these jeans. The fabric is lightweight and feels somewhat satiny.

I have only worn them a couple of times, but on both occasions, I have received compliments. I really enjoy them, and hope that you will too.",A Light Brown Pair Of Jeans Decorated With Off White Dragonflies

The bag is incredibly light, which is another huge selling point - especially when you need to lift it into the overhead bins on an airplane.

5,Initially I was going to get the burgundy color one but they didn't have my size. I am glad I got the blue instead. As it was a nice purchase. It doesn't look like the picture provided by the seller. Nor does it look like something I included in my picture in this review. However its just a nice sky blue colored sweater. Its 100% cotton and didn't irritate my skin. Plus the price point of the sweater was nice as many sweater similar can cost much more. I did receive this product at a discounted price for my review. However this is one of those products that even if I didn't get a discount I would think it was a nice purchase. Just a heads up for style purpose. If you like the modern and slim fit than the sizing should be normal. I got my size and it fit just right. Not sure how it will come out after I wash it though. If you like your sweaters to fit a little loser than get a size up. That's my suggestion and input.,Great Fit Nice Color (Picture included)

5,"This is my second purchase of a Ted Baker polyvinyl chloride bag and I like them a lot. They do arrive smelly and stiff, but if you unwrap it and let it sit for a few days, it's less overwhelming, and the smell greatly diminishes over time. (I bought my first bag last year and it smells fine now.) Once you start using it, it stays a nice shape as long as you don't squish it under anything. It's the perfect size for lots of sheet music and books. My only complaint is that these bags do not like the cold. I live in Michigan and once it got below freezing out, just simply walking from my car to work, this bag would act so stiff it almost seemed frozen, and then eventually one of the straps cracked because of the cold. I had it professionally repaired and it looks great, but still something to watch out for. Thus a great bag for summer!","So beautiful, but doesn't like cold weather."

The thing that makes it the hardest to play in is the length.  My daughter is 24 lbs and about 34 inches tall and this hangs mid calf on her.  I think as she gets a little taller this will continue to fit and just get a bit shorter which will make it a better play dress.  The quality of the dress is outstanding.

She isn't tall but the shirt barely comes to her hips on the highest point on the side. Again, this is a child wearing an adult shirt. I'm not even sure sizing up two sizes would be enough for adult women wanting to wear it. It is well made. The royal blue is very purple. I would say size up three sizes. This shirt is tiny.",Small Fits My 9 Year Old
5,"Well crafted and fits as expected.  If your a big man who doesn't want to look like a loser is typical ""big and tall"" clothes, this is a win.  Material is light weight and warm. Pockets are ample, with even a small security pocket on the inside.  Wish there were other colors...because most big/tall is either black or blue.

The slit is perfect, not too high at all. Very figure flattering. I haven't washed it yet so I can't answer to shrinkage.

5,This dog tag is absolutely nice and kool..(even for a Man). I always wanted a dog tag.. but something a little different than the traditional squared dog tags even they are nice also. But I got this one instead because it was a rounded shape and I am glad I did. The diamonds on this tag is not overbearing but definitely noticeable. I mean it has SHINE and BLING. And to my surprise the chain has a appearance of almost white gold even tho it is brass. It is my first brass chain and this chain is stunning. I bought this for the dog tag but was blown away at the tag and the chain.  So I'll say where this dog tag to your finer affairs because the diamonds on it look way more Expensive. And better yet I have a white gold chain I'm going to wear the dog tag on only because the two together is awesome. And the chain I'll wear alone because it's so stunning it doesn't need a pendant of any kind. This piece I will cherish 4ever cause I only wanted ONE and this is it. It is surely a keeper's keep sake.,"If you like diamonds...""GET IT"""

He also loves Disney and he gets that from me. So it was great that both sides could be represented! It is a nice size clip - it did not look too big on him. It is a gorgeous silver. It was easy to clip onto the tie yet it stayed in place all day. We loved the box that it came in. It was a nice touch and a great place for him to keep the tie clip when he is not wearing it. So many people stopped to ask him where he got the clip and to tell him how much they loved it. He will have this clip forever. Beautiful!,Wonderful for a Disney fan! Beautiful tie clip!

5,"Since there aren't any reviews on this, I decided to give some feedback and help anyone looking to buy them. I was very skeptical about these sunglasses. I've never heard of this company before. So, I bit the bullet and bought them. Gotta tell you that these are much better than my ray bans. Very light and seem to be of a very good quality. They are so light that it took me a while to get used to them. The design is a bit...how do I put it...different. I like them. My eyes rest with these sunglasses. Also, the nose rest is very good. Very comfortable. I bought for less at woot's sale. However, if I had a choice to buy them again at the Amazon's price, I'd do it. It's worth it. The only thing I don't like about them is crappy warranty and no booklet or cool case. But that's a minor thing.",Cool and incredibly light

I love the colors and how the stones are channel set. The post that goes through the ear is thin and the clasp is secure. The little stones are all natural and well-cut. They have a good amount of sparkle. The yellow gold plating adds a warmth that complements the gemstones.

I love how colorful the hoops are. They are understated, so they're not too fancy to wear with jeans and casual outfits. The quality is excellent and they don't look cheap. Comfortable to wear, and so light that I forget I'm wearing them. The earrings are stamped with: ""PAJ,"" ""925,"" and ""CHINA."" They are made by Prime Art & Jewel.",Multi-Gemstone Hoops

Good weight, good material, never rusts or tarnishes, insanely inexpensive. The first one took a month to arrive and the second took a week, because who even knows about overseas logistics, man. Other things from the same brand are just as good too and they always send a velvet pouch and a necklace chain that's equally indestructible, which is cool.",... of these on separate occasions because they're just that nice (one got made into prayer beads

My daughter is 19 months old and not walking so I bought these hoping they would supply ankle support to help her stand up and thought she would love the squeaker and WANT to walk! I was right with both! The only negative I have to say is that I ordered according to the size chart posted and it is WRONG. Order the standard size your child wears- she needs a 5 but the size chart says a 7 so these are very big on her. The positives are too many to list, honestly. Great quality, flexible but sturdy for newer walkers, great sole, very comfortable, easily removed sqeakers & beautiful! Yes,they are pricey but good boots are =)",Love! But size chart is WRONG!

5,I am so in love with this! Honestly when I purchased it I wasn't entirely convinced if it would be worth the money as some fan products I've gotten in the past are obviously more for looks than functionality. But this wallet is well made and has worked out well since I've started using it. It was easy to switch over from my standard wristlet and find a place for all my cards and cash. I've also gotten so many compliments on it and it's started so many nostalgic conversations from both friends and total strangers. The only downside is the slight fraying from the inner zipper but I just trim it now and then so it's not a huge issue for me.,"Love, Love, Love!"

5,"I have bought New Era 39Thirty stretch fit hats before. I have seen others write posts that the feel they run big. I have a big head (7 3/4 fitted cap size), and 39Thirty L/XL hats fit me just right, so I knew this would fit me just right. I can understand that people with a smaller head might have a tough time deciding between the bigger or smaller hat. Maybe if 39Thirty had a middle size, it would be a better choice for those who find the small hat tight and the large one too large. If you are ordering this and have never bought a 39Thirty stretch fit cap before, I suggest you go to a local sporting goods or hat store (Dick's Sporting Goods, a ""Lids"" store in a shopping mall, etc.) and try on a 39Thirty cap to decide which size you want before you buy. The embroidery and logos are top notch. Highest quality baseball hats out there.",Best brand of stretch fitted caps made

5,"SO SO SO COMFY. And even though they're thin material and probably not meant to be worn outside, given that I got a dark color they're okay to wear for a quick run to a convenience store a block away, as long as it's not raining...

Don't go out with loaded pockets (heavy key ring with lots of keys, fat wallet, and so on) because even with the drawstring, gravity will pull these shorts down to your ankles. But they're not really meant for going out, remember?

If you're used to sleeping naked, and your sister is coming for a visit and bringing her young kids (or you're going to visit her) and you just need something to wear so that you're not that weird brother/ cousin/ uncle walking around naked? or you have to answer the door for the mailman, or pizza delivery, and just need to throw something on quick? these are PERFECT. And even if you're quite comfortable being naked in your own home, they are so comfy that you might find yourself leaving them on, even after the coast is clear and it's socially acceptable for you to be naked again.

Plan on getting more, so I always have at least 1 or 2 clean ones around.",LOVE. THEM.

5,"I can see why some reviewers had issues with this boot, but overall I'm pleased with them. The major problem is the lack of arch support and cushioning- which can cause discomfort or even pain after a full day for some depending on their particular foot shape and issues. Both the footbed design and a poor quality stock insole are responsible for this problem. I typically use custom insoles to get the right support for my needs and actually prefer the ""flat"" footbed because it provides a neutral base for the replacement orthotic to rest on without any shape distortion. So if you use an orthotic, this isn't an issue. If you typically just keep the stock insole, I'd recommend swapping for a replacement cushioning one in these boots to add some comfort. Other than that, they are well constructed, solid casual chukka boots. I really like the look and after some break-in period, they've become a favorite. I'm glad I took a chance and ordered them!",Great Casual Boots- But Consider A Replacement Insole

5,"Looked nice! I got a phone call from my college son that he needed a suit cause he'd told a girl he'd go to some ""spring fling"" dance-- in a week. HA! He doesn't have a car so doesn't get around too well at college so our options were for me to drive 4 hours to take him shopping or try to find one online. We looked at ebay and all the shipping times were way out there. We decided to look on Amazon where we found this Perry Ellis Suit Jacket. The reviews said it had a slim fit so we thought it would work. We were worried about what size to get cause he'd never gotten a suit coat but the size chart was a big help. But it was just the jacket--- no pants. As we looked we found that many of the slacks were not hemmed or weren't offered in his size, but we were able to find the actual ones that matched the jacket! And they were hemmed and came in his size so JACKPOT! The whole suit --pants and jacket--was $140 which I didn't think was a bad price at all. He thought there was a little too much padding in the shoulders but I think it looks great. He wore it to his sister's wedding with a skinny tie and looked fantastic!",Five Stars-- looked fantastic!

5,"I've been wearing Jag jeans for a while so I ordered these to wear as jeggings. Actually, I ordered them first in sz. 12 and loved them but felt that they were a tad too big. I returned them and ordered a sz. 10 which were tighter than I wanted. I looked for an alternative but couldn't find anything to compare to the quality, material and comfort of these leggings. So, I decided to order the sz. 12 AGAIN and am happy that I did. I will shrink them just a little and they will be perfect. What I really loved about these is that they are not too tight in the waistline and do not cause that ugly ""muffin top"" that I hate. Also, the length is great for me (5'6"") because they kind of scrunch around the ankle and look good without boots, and they lay nicely inside of a high boot as well. The material is thick and very much like denim but stretch like a knit. It's just like wearing a comfortable pair of pajama bottoms but are very stylish. So, it's not always true to size down with Jags depending on the look you are going after. I have sz. 10s and sz. 12s in Jags and they all fit well according to the style of jeans that they are. I highly highly recommend this jegging and this line of jeans to anyone regardless of size and age of the wearer!",Love Love Love These Jeggings!

It's not too bright and flashy, nor does it seem overly dull and faded. The pockets are spacious and well organized. I'm usually not a big fan of snaps like these, but the two holding down the top flap seem to be of a good quality and add a nice touch of style to the overall aesthetics of the bag. I don't want to sound like I'm just endlessly gushing over this bag, but I really can't come up which much I don't like about it. I would make the zipper across the top shorter so it can't dangle and catch on things (you can see it with a brown thing hanging down into the bag in one of my pics), but that's just small detail. Overall this bag it great and I highly recommend it.",Solid and Beautiful Backpack

I spend everyday at our local pool while my son does his tennis and swimming lessons and I needed something that I could wear that would cover the parts of my body I don't want exposed but yet not be stiflingly hot. This cover up has completely met those needs.

Pros: very light weight and airy. Keeps the parts of my body I don't want exposed covered up while still allowing me to stay cool. Is made of a synthetic material so can stand up to sunscreen and chlorine everyday. Fit and shape of the cover up is very flattering and comfortable. Looks nice enough that I have gotten compliments on it. I just rinse it with cold water after being pool side and hang it to dry with all of our other swim wear and it has held up quite well so far.

Cons: The tag is a bit ridiculous, but easily fixed by cutting off the excess. Sleeves are flowy and drapey so they can't be rolled up and the sleeves are a little bit too long for me.

Overall, I would recommend this cover up and I will most likely buy another one.",Flattering while keeping cool poolside
5,"Nice looking shirt, has a sheen to it, fit small for my guy, he's xxl, he felt uncomfortable, wants to loose a few pounds so the fit won't be too tight, great price, would purchase again. Thanks!",Nice

5,"Amazing all day mountaineering boots. The Mont Blanc Pro GTX fit like a glove right out of the box. I have used these for multiday winter backpacking trips and also 12 hour mountaineering adventures. These have been some of the best money I have spent for outdoor gear.

The built in gator keeps snow out when you are post holing. The insulation is enough to keep you warm but not too much.

The only room for improvement would be a slightly larger piece of webbing in the back to help pull them on.",The best all day mountaineering boots. Love them!

5,"I bought this to wear at my daughter's wedding (one of her colors was turquoise). I normally wear a size 12, but that size was not available. I tried a 14 plus, but there was enough room for another body inside the dress with me;) I was discouraged until I read the reviews about the dress running large.

5,"Exactly what I wanted, and they came fairly quickly too! Love them.",Love them.
5,"I bought these for two reasons--because we are taking a trip to Wisconsin at Christmastime and because my son is OBSESSED with anything and everything camo.  When I was offered this set at a deeply discounted price, I could not reject the offer.

QUALITY--These are made of your typical fleece and extremely soft. The fibers are durable, yet they allow your skin to breathe.  I would say that these are good for early or late winter, but probably not for the middle of the winter when it's the coldest.  These would also be good for those crazy people (like myself) who like to go for a run in the winter, need something to keep our hands just warm and something on our heads to keep the heat from escaping, but nothing too bulky.

COMFORT--I tried them on myself. They are very comfy and perfect for chilly weather.

SIZE--Both the hat and the gloves are made for up to size medium men, in my opinion.  I think if you require a large, they might not work for you.  The hat is super stretchy, but it's not as big/roomy as many hats you find men wearing these days.

This is a GREAT set for the price!  You definitely get your money's worth!",PERFECT FOR ANY CAMO LOVER!

5,"Love this bag and the color is perfect. This is my 2ND cadie kipling bag and I wanted a green one. It  has 2 separate zippered sections and an open one inbetween that has a snap. It also has a small zipper compartment on the front of the bag too. That compartment it great for chapstick, gum, or any other small item you need access to quickly. The bag works well for work or a day trip or even for everyday use. I like to use one zippered side to keep  wallet or any paperwork that I need to bring with me. The other zippered side I put small small snacks and either kindle or iPad. The middle section works well to keep my kleen Kanteen with either coffee or water in it or to have a light sweater in it for when it gets a little cool .I also like it keep my cell phone in the middle pocket too for convenience.  I love the two shoulder straps that is has but, I still carry it with the crossbody it comes with most of the time.",Love this bag and the color is perfect

It fit very nicely! I'd only say that the top slips out of the belt, but it isn't really that irritating. (and the cape hides the belt's bow-tie strategy at the back)
the fabric is a little delicate, but for a 1-3 day event this was great. the wig was a little lacking in hair so you might want to get a different wig. the eye piece--definitely adjust the eye hole with shears (i recommend small ones made for hair cutting, because it cuts cleaner and easier to utilize).

5,"When you first put in your credit cards, drivers license or whatever in the slots, it takes a bit of finesse.  But after you remove them a couple of times, they come in/out with normal effort.  They don't wiggle loose after usage.  The middle slot is the hardest to get to, so I just put my least used cards in there.  I use the bottom slot for places where I need to flash a card like Costco so I don't need to pull it out at the entrance door.  I would not consider putting cash in any of the slots but just attach a money clip or get a coin purse if needed.  The stitching is top notch with no stragglers and loose ends.  The leather feels very comfortable in my hands and front pockets even wearing sweats.  Hilfiger has many design options to choose from with this configuration of pockets.  A tip would be to insert your Cards with the electromagnetic strip going in last so you don't consistently scuff it up.",Top Quality CC Holder

5,"After I got this (originally for the rock climbing gym), I just tried it on at home --- and didn't want to take it off. Or, well, didn't want to take it off any other time I wore it. It is somewhat hard to see from the picture/description, but it is a very stretchy, matt, pretty thick fabric (more a thin pullover than a shirt), with incredibly soft, fleece-like interior. It is definitely warm, would not work for warmer weather, but as it is, I love it. So soft.
By the way, it also looks way nicer than a regular gym shirt, especially the neck line.

Size: It runs a little small; I'm about 120lb., 5'6, usually between XS and S in cloths and an S in OR activewear, and an S in this one is pretty tight on me. It's ok for the gym, but if you would like it to be less form-fitting, then order at least a size up.",Don't want to take it off

5,"After reading other reviews about the toe room I ordered a half size up (I am a 7 so I ordered a 7.5). I have plenty of toe room and the shoe doesn't feel too big it feels like it is the right size for my foot. I've worn them for an entire day, taking them off when I got home and putting them back on again when I went back out and the zipper hasn't stuck once. Even though the heel doesn't feel as tall as it looks and is wide and cushiony so wearing them for a long period of time might not hurt as much, at least they haven't hurt me and I have been wearing them all day. I do wear heels quite often so if you are not used to a taller heel maybe this is not the best shoe for you. The shoes squeak just a little bit, barely noticeable, but i suspect that will stop once I have worn the shoes in!

5,"First of all, this is an unbelievably lightweight pack for the size and for the amount it can hold. This is well-made, as are all of Osprey's products, and has all of the features that one would expect in a backpack of this caliber.  There's a hydration compartment, sleeping bag section, and handy zippered pockets on the side that are easy to access.  Honestly, I love this feature. There were many features that I had to look up and figure out on my own, which was kind of a pain.  A small manual would have been helpful.  Also, the strap is way long, which happens with just about every backpack that I have owned, so that is nothing new. I did not have to adjust the harness height, and thank goodness, because I could not figure out how to do it.  However, the overall design and look of this backpack is excellent.

5,"This is a beautiful and comfortable cotton dress. I always get compliments when I wear it. The front part is nicely lined and the back is a good-weight cotton knit that falls nicely and doesn't show lumps or bulges. It is the darkest navy imaginable - almost black. I say it runs somewhat small only because I find that sizes have typically gotten bigger - I think of it as vanity sizing. I have it in a medium and it fits perfectly and I would consider myself to be a medium, so in that respect it fits as expected. However, lately I am finding that I more often need a small. For instance, I recently returned a Jones New York dress that I had ordered in a medium and it was huge on me so I returned it for a small. So if you feel you are between sizes, go for the larger.",Love this dress!

Strong, quality-made hardware. It just feels different than anything else. I've had more expensive bags, but none as nice as this one.

I usually wear S/M. Ordered L size fits perfectly.",I love this jacket
5,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect with these and with such a wait to get them I was really rolling the dice. However, I'm extremely pleased with them. I totally expected the softness of the cotton-it's why we buy Egyptian, right? However, what I didn't expect was the comfort of the scrotum pouch. It's been many years since I had a fly in my underwear and it takes getting used to but it's totally worth it for the comfort and fine construction these offer. I would agree with them that one should order a size up from the measurements. I didn't on this order, however, they're still comfortable enough and I know that they'll break in to be more so. I've already ordered a second pair, in a size up and believe that for the combination of price and product that these will be my go-to underwear for quite awhile. The wait for them...well, quality is worth it. Update after two months. I've thrown out the medium size ones. I still wear a 32 inch waist pants but the 32 inch underwear continue to shrink as time goes on. The two other pair that I've bought in a 36 inch have shrunk to fit quite nicely though. I wish that I'd listened to the company in the first place.",Quality and comfort are worth the wait

5,I love these shoes. The reviews were mixed on the sizing so I just ordered a 7.5 like I normally would and they fit fine. They're very comfortable and provide support.,I love these shoes
5,"You really need to pay attention to the reviews of others when purchasing items such as these...this is why I also always leave clear and honest reviews so I know what to expect and I hope I help others to know what they are getting as well.  All the reviews stated that this beanie fits small and they all were right on the money!  However, knowing that going in, I went ahead & purchased this beanie for my son.  It's hard to find SAO items of any kind, so it was worth the risk.  My son has a large head (containing the brain of a genius, in my opinion, lol!) so I found a ball of my granddaughter's that was slightly larger than his head and stretched the beanie on it for a bit before he wore it.  Worked like a charm!  Anything anime from Asia is going to be much smaller than US sizes, so knowing this in advance avoids disappointment.  The graphics in this beanie are much better in person than the pictures show, and the shipping time was way faster than the estimate I was given upon ordering.  He loves it, so I'm happy with this purchase and would buy it again.",My Son Loves It

5,"Okay, so I am assuming that this seller intends to focus their product line to automatic movement watches that are capable of sitting on the shelf for long periods of time and then being restarted. I am also assuming that because of this, the quartz movement watches they have in stock suffer for requiring battery power. I'm making these assumptions because after reading other reviews it seems par for the course to receive this watch with a dead battery. I read the reviews before purchase and decided to take my chances anyway. I as well received a beautiful watch that was completely dead. I had also, however received and email from the seller with a PDF of the new manual. I responded to the email and explained that my watch didn't work. By the very next morning the seller had already done literally everything possible to resolve the issue.  It should be noted that the watch is understated, classic and extremely comfortable. It is a bargain at this price. You may or may not receive a working watch initially but I am confident that you will certainly have an extremely positive customer service experience that will eventually result in a working watch.",5 stars

However, I have stupid feet with issues and after having them on me for a few hours at home, I wasn't confident enough they would be comfortable for the lot haul. Im certain most people wouldnt have an issue, but considering the price I wanted to know they would be the best.

From the first minute I can walk for hours in this shoes. You should use special running socks / walking socks dedicated for the left and the right foot, then your experience is even more enjoyable. The only minor downside is that this shoes are not protected against rain. If it rains you get wet feet, but here in Florida this is a minor disadvantage.

5,"This is much better quality than I expected.
I ordered this tee for my nephew to make sure he learned and remembered some math symbols (green with I eight sum pi).  Most printed tees are thin material with poor construction - not this one.  It is a nice weight 100% cotton with straight well sewn seams.
This arrived much more quickly than expected which was another plus.

This is a funny tee to those who understand.  To others it requires some thinking.  And to most people, maybe something will be learned.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
I don't usually give five star ratings, however this is an extraordinary printed tee.",GREAT

The wallet comes exactly as advertised and is packaged very well (if you were giving it to someone as a gift). I like how easy the cash fits into it. The only thing to be aware of is that cards bigger than a regular ID/ credit card size may be hard to fit into some of the slots, but the back slots and clear ID slot can fit full rectangular shaped cards (like a store punch card), just may be tight. Overall if you are looking for something cute, small, and pratical, this is perfect!","Cute, Small, and Practical!"

I also appreciate that they are somewhat gender neutral, in black, silver and blue considering how hard it is to find girl shoes that are not pink.",We are in love with these shoes!

5,"I purchased this handmade leather wrap bracelet from Amazon seller Christenelle and I could not be happier with my purchase.  This bracelet is STUNNING!! Wrap bracelets are my favorite type of bracelet.  I have Fibromyalgia and I have to wear jewelry that is pretty lightweight so that it does not hurt me.  Although these bracelets are big they are not heavy at all.  The bracelet comes in one long bracelet that has several loops on it and you wrap it around your wrist (this one is 5 times) and put the loop around the button at the length that is the most comfortable to you.  You then cut off the excess loops.  This bracelet can be worn with very fancy clothes or with your daily attire. This bracelet has the most beautiful sparkle to it and the black matches everything I own.  I highly recommend this bracelet and I can't wait to get another Christenelle bracelet.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  The seller was guaranteed no stars and no positive review.  The opinions expressed in this review are 100% my own.

5,"I love this coat.  I wore it in 30 degree weather with a long sleeved shirt and sweater underneath.  I thought the peatmoss was going to be brown, which i wasn't thrilled about, but it is greener than it looks in this photo.  It's a pretty forest green.

I ordered the large.  I'm 5'6"" 150 lbs and the large fits nicely.  Room underneath for layering and I can still move around comfortably.
Great length.  Covers my butt and legs, hits me just above the knee.  Makes a huge difference having these areas covered.

I'm ordering another one for my son.",I love this coat.

5,"I hesitated to get this top because it had several reviews that suggested it wasn't very good, but I decided to go ahead with it.  I'm a 38DD and it's exactly what I wanted in size 14.  It's snug, and holds everything in, and seems like it will do well underwater.  I plan to wear it under rashguards, and just wanted a little extra support, and I think they'll do fine.  I'm not sure why some people say it won't do compression because It certainly does, and it says so on the tags that I got.  I'll update after my trip to say how it did, but so far i'm happy with my purchase.

Just got back from my trip and it was fantastic!  I swam with it under a rash guard several times, and it gave comfortable support for swimming and full enough coverage that after getting out of the water i was comfortable taking off the rash guard to towel off.  Absolutely consider this for swimming!","... it had several reviews that suggested it wasn't very good, but I decided to go ahead with it"

5,"These extra tall black suspenders have a silky sheen that I couldn't see in the ad's pictures. The material is sturdy and has a confident feel. If you are wondering if they are tall enough or much longer than regular length suspenders, yes, they are much longer with plenty of room. In regular suspenders I have them at full length. With these I have a few inches to go.

The clamps on these are the same that this brand uses on their other similar models. I had to purchase these new suspenders because the ones I purchased from this same company in white and regular length had one of the clamps break after a couple years of use averaging one or two times each month. It bent when I found it broken and I have been unable to repair the clamp. I wear these suspenders with a low budget mock tuxedo and no one is the wiser as the clamps cannot be seen under a cummerbund. I hope they will offer these extra long suspenders in white.","Very Tall, Solid Construction Formal Tuxedo Suspenders"

Color me happy, Amazon had them at a better price and a wider color selection.  I'm all about versatility and comfort, while still looking good.  These booties fit the bill!  They come up high enough on the ankle to give good support if you stand or walk all day, but are still low enough to be considered a bootie.  The style is great and looks fantastic with skirts and pants for work, or jeans for those casual days.  Comfort, quality and style - these boots are a great score.","Comfort, Quality and Style!

I am 5'10"", 174 lbs and usually need L - I ordered 3XL based on other reviews and it's perfect. I purchased the coat on February 2015 and it is still in perfect condition after I took it to Europe and abused it a little. It protects you from extreme cold and wind, but when it's up to 55 degrees you don't sweat too much. It looks pretty good, if I am to believe compliments I receive. I stopped using an umbrella because it protects you from rain perfectly well. It's easy to roll and pack in a carry-on once you push and squeeze the air out of it.

5,"I've just received these boots and have only worn them once.  Nevertheless, I love these boots. As far as appearance is concerned, they look the same as pictured. Perfect to wear with dresses, skirts, and skinny jeans.  I normally wear a size 8 1/2 in boots, which is what I purchased.  Initially, I thought they were too small/snug. I almost was going to send them back. I'm glad I didn't, because after walking in them for a few minutes they stretched out perfectly. I did only wear them once, but I was on my feet for most of that day. From someone who has chronic pain, these boots were very comfortable to walk in.",Love These Boots

5,"These shoes are very attractive and very well made, they look expensive.  The quality is evident in the lacings and fabric tongue which holds the lacings in place.  I especially notice the rigid heel which hugs my foot at the back and conforms easily to the bottom of my heel.  The fit is roomy, with spacious toe box. I ordered my usual 10 and with socks they are perfect.  I normally wear a 9-1/2 in street shoes.  The style is neat and conservative yet does not look like granny or orthopedic shoes.  The purple color is very nice, not too bright but noticeable as purple. I am a senior and appreciate firm secure support when I am walking or just doing tasks around the house.  I get lots of compliments and questions about the brand.","Very well made, excellent quality and the best fit for comfortable all day wear"

Resin is satisfyingly thick and not super heavy.  My face didn't perfectly fit the mask (eyes and mouth are a bit further apart), but I wouldn't take that away from the rating as a whole.  I think the mask came with a ding/hole or 2 above the eyebrow and directly beneath the right cheekbone, but it's barely noticeable and I feel like it adds to the look a bit.  Shipping was very, very quick.  Perfect, I think, for masquerades and costume parties.

5,"I have worn this ear-warmer headband several times this winter in the cold weather (teens & twenties) and it has done its job nicely.  Good quality with a soft fleece feel on the inside.  It is very comfortable to wear and is a perfect fit.  Since it is so slim, on the coldest days I wear it under a knit cap.  I really do recommend this for the outside ear and also for the comfort of the inside ear, to avoid ear aches.  This winter headband meets my needs very well!",Practical and Looks Good
5,"WOW! It arrived the next day, 7 DAYS earlier than expected! And the purse is nicer than in the picture, too. The fake leather is very supple and a rich colored black. The lining is a pretty beige and black striped silky material. The gold tones on the hardware are just the right touch, making a backpack style look a classy. Totally worth the 30 clams.

For those of you wondering: I can fit a 9.5""X6"" notebook and a water bottle in it and still have plenty of room for sunglasses, a wallet, keys and cell phone. Yet it's not big and bulky like most back packs. On one shoulder it just looks like a regular (yet classy) hand bag. I'm very happy so far!

EDIT: I bought this in October and it's now the end of May. I use this purse almost every day and it still looks great and it has yet to rip a seem or loose any hardware. And I STUFF it too. Scripts rolled up, a water bottle, the notebook... never a problem. This is good quality. Wow.

Why do I like purses in the style of a backpack? I live in the city and walk/bike everywhere. Backpacks are harder for thieves to run buy and rip it off your person. I also noticed the number of ""can you spare some change"" diminishes since they can't immediately see my purse. Also- the obvious- hands free communing. And since this one is so classy, I can go from class to a party or bar without having to go home and switch purses.

I just got it, so I can't comment yet on it's durability. This is replacing a similar styled backpack purse I bought in China Town; wherein the strap broke in the first week and the main zipper broke within a month. I'll post again in a few months to let you know how well it held up.",Perfect! Very Happy!

5,"These quickly became my favorite wedge sandals. They're easy to walk in. The location of the straps makes them incredibly comfortable... No toe pinching or squeezing. They soles are very supportive and I can walk a long time in them.

These sandals are incredibly versatile. They work well with dresses, skirts, jeans, shorts, and rompers. Personally, I like how they pair with rompers the most.

The metal hardware logo tag gives them a classy look.

The one and only issue is that they're quite noisy. When I walk in them, they produce a ""flippity-flop"" sound, especially when tracking across hard surfaces. But as long as you're not planning on sneaking up on anyone, they're great!

FYI: These sandals are also ideal if you have bunions (enlarged bones at the base of the big toes) that you want to conceal.",My Favorite Wedge Sandals!

5,"If you have (or even know) kids - you know they outgrow clothes like it's their job.  As a mommy of 2 under two, I swear it physically pains me when I have to pack away perfectly good clothes because they pinch on that cute baby fat or leave the rolly ankles/wrists out in the breeze.  I can't imagine how or why, but this outfit has lasted us OVER A YEAR BEING ACTIVELY WORN.  Truly, I cannot imagine how many times it's been worn and washed, but has to be upwards of 30 (most outfits round out at about 5 around here).  We got it when our was one (I know it's 24 mo. but she was a chunk) and she's now just over and it still fits like a charm.  In the early days we had to cuff the pants but now they're just right.  It's high quality too, because it got washed SO much and still looks just about new (sadly, this cannot be said of many children's clothes which pill, shrink and fade).  I feel like I'm trying you sell you on this, and I guess I am - no benefit for me, just love having something in her drawers that has stayed nice and fit for so long (meanwhile she has outgrown a million other things).  Plus, the sweatshirt is really cute and versatile - she has worn it over many other outfits.  The fact that it has no hood is a great perk, because I feel more comfortable letting her nap, etc in it.  The little skirted bit adds a nice girly touch too.","One outfit that will LAST the test of time, and crazy growth spurts!"

I was only expecting a shirt, but I got directions on how to wash the shirt, a little thank you letter, and two photo cards that came with each shirt! Also, a small fits me perfectly, and Im 112 and 53. I would totally buy again! (Haha ignore the picture with weird eyes; I do it in pictures hehe)",So Cute!

First, the color... Its simply amazing in person, very unique. She is complimented on it all the time. The band feels very well made and appears that it will hold up very well over time.

This one will make the lady in your life very happy.",A beautiful timepiece. Well done Nixon.

5,"I ordered too large but I will give this product 5 stars.  The fleece is extremely comfortable, breathable but supportive. One of the biggest problems with finding a hoodie to work out in is how it constricts in the shoulder and bottom arm area.  This fleece does neither.  It provides light weight durability that stretches with your body, allowing maximum  movement.  I gave the XL to my buddy and will instead pick up the large or medium.",Excellent Fleece for working out or Lounging

5,"This pendant was purchased as part of my 35th Anniversary gift for my wife.  It was delivered about one week earlier than planned (@2 weeks after order placement), and was therefore received well within the time needed.  Addtionally, the Pendant matched the weight written in the item specification, the color was very close to that of the photo, and it looked great-better than the photo.  (The photo does not adequately capture a translucent quality in portions of the Jade Rose that adds to a high quality appearance).  The chain for the necklace was very fine and lightweight, but adequate.  (Being as lightweight (as it is) could be a problem with frequent wearing for some however, this was never planned by me to be the actual chain used with the pendant).  The jewelry box & surrounding exterior container were well constructed.  Very ""Nice for the Price""!  My bride was very pleased with this necklace and said that I should write that it is the best Jade jewelry I have ever bought her!  (Of course this is our first 35th Anniversary and is also the first time I have bought Jade jewelry for her, but ... she likes it) !!  Thank you.",Excellent Product!  Received prior to original delivery date.  Great Buying Expereince!

5,"I love the style of this pajama set thats why i bought it for my 2 months old baby boy, i would say that the quality or the cotton material used is soft perfect for my baby because he has delicate skin, i also love the style and the pattern, my baby is big for his age thats why i bought 3 months size and it fits perfectly on him, the only problem is that the hat is too big for him and the pants is too long because my son is kinda bit short, it was my first time to bought this brand and i would say that i was kinda impressed and i would like to buy more clothes in the future, although its pricey for a pajama set, but definitely i would recommend this brand to all the parents out there.",Love this!

5,"I was looking for a pair of shoes to knock around in. Primarily I wear heeled boots. My previous sneakers were a pair of Converse All Stars. However, they don't provide the kind of support my feet need, now, and would cause my feet to hurt. These Saucony's, on the other hand, looked more like the Vibram 5fingers that I'd jog in, in that they have low profile soles and a more forward stance. I was not disappointed.

I can wear these shoes all day and not have any problems. They're comfortable and breathable. Even after the months of wear and tear on them, the shoes are still holding up. I was concerned that the thinner soles would wear out faster, but was pleasantly mistaken.","A good, comfortable sneaker."

5,"My 4 year old daughter is really hard on her school shoes. I used to buy her inexpensive shoes, since I know she tends to thrash her clothes and shoes at school. But replacing a $10 pair of shoes every month is no fun. Despite being several times the cost I decided to try these Keen's. I'm happy to say that they have lasted her the entire school year, and are in good enough shape that they could be passed down and used even longer!  Even the velcro has held up beautifully. It was well worth the seemingly high cost.

My daughter's feet are a little on the wide side, and these fit comfortably on her. She's really sensitive to bumps/textures/pinching/etc. on her feet and toes, and these have caused her zero distress. She's able to run around and roughhouse all day in these, and her feet stay happy.",Sturdy shoes for school

I like having no tan lines on my shoulders.  I normally wear a size 18-20 and 40-42DD and the 18 fits perfect.  It does stretch out over time but thats mostly my fault.,"Easy wear, go to suit"

5,Fit great,Five Stars
5,"I am 5'7"", roughly (ha!) 190 lbs. I usually wear L or XL, but got XXL because the reviews said to go a little bigger.

The coat looks lovely and can be worn with jeans or slightly dressier attire (as I usually wear). It seems very well-made, and I did not notice any weird problems with zippers or anything like that. It is not hideously puffy like most winter coats, but fits snugly, and is quite flattering. It won't quite do for the most brutal depths of a Chicago winter, perhaps ... but for a $60 Lightning Deal, it provides excellent value. (And it might just do with the addition of a warm hat & gloves. We Chicagoans are a hardy stock.)

I may get another in black, and would not mind paying the full price for it.","Great-looking Coat, Excellent Value"

I love these so much did not want to return them, so decided to scrub the soles with barkeepers friend and a stiff brush. Worked perfect, now can wear them without fear of slipping. I'm giving them 5 stars because I fixed the slip issue.","Warning, slippery soles."
